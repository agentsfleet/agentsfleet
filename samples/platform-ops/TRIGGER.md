    # fails fast and the agent reasons from the error.

  budget:
    # Two independent hard caps — the first to trip blocks further runs.
    # They do NOT compose (daily × 30 ≠ monthly); this is intentional.
    #
    # `monthly_dollars` is the real spend envelope: the $10 starter credit
    # minus $2 of headroom so a second zombie fits. At typical cost (~$0.30
    # per diagnosis) it bites after ~26 runs in a normal month.
    #
    # `daily_dollars` is a blast-radius guard, not a pro-rated monthly share
    # (which would be ~$0.27 — too tight; one normal run would trip it).
    # $1 ≈ 3 normal runs' worth; hitting it in one UTC day means something
    # is wrong (stuck reasoning, prompt injection spamming tool calls) and
    # the right move is to pause and inspect, not burn the whole month.
