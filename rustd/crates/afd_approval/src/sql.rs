/// is being asked about, and a denormalised copy would go stale the moment the
/// fleet is renamed.

/// `COALESCE(z.name, '')` because the column is nullable and an inbox row with
/// a null name would be a card with a blank heading rather than an unnamed one.
///
/// The keyset predicate is `($5 = false OR (created_at, id) > ($6, $7))`, which
/// is a TUPLE comparison and not two `AND`ed inequalities: gates raised in the
/// same millisecond are common — one run parks several tools at once — and a
/// naive `created_at > $6` would skip every sibling of the cursor row.
///
/// `$1` workspace, `$2` status, `$3` fleet filter, `$4` kind filter,
/// `$5` has-cursor, `$6` cursor instant, `$7` cursor id, `$8` limit.
