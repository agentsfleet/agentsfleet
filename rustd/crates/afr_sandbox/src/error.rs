//! What building or destroying a sandbox refuses, and what it reports.
//!
//! One error type with `pub type Result<T, E = Error>` beside it, under the
//! `afd_core::error_shell!` hull every `rustd` crate carries: the boxed kind
//! keeps `Result` pointer-sized on the `Ok` path, and the captured backtrace,
//! the `[CODE]` rendering and the self-skipping `source()` are generated.
//!
//! # Which codes, and why none are new
//!
//! A runner failure is read by an operator on the host's journal, never by a
//! tenant or an API client, so it reuses the registry's existing codes the way
//! `afd_bench` does (`docs/RUST_ERROR_STANDARD.md`); the `event` field on the
//! log line says which failure it was. Minting a `UZ-RUN-*` code would publish
//! it in `public/openapi.json` for a condition no client can observe.
