# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Per-runner Prometheus metrics on `agentsfleetd` `/metrics`: `agentsfleet_runner_failures_total{runner_id,reason}`, `agentsfleet_runner_executions_total{runner_id,outcome}`, `agentsfleet_runner_last_seen_seconds{runner_id}`, `agentsfleet_runner_active_leases{runner_id}` — in-memory slot table, scrape-path DB-free, `runner_id="_other"` overflow at capacity
- Grafana dashboard JSON (`deploy/grafana/runner_fleet.json`) — runner-fleet observability; 6 panels with multi-replica-correct PromQL aggregation (`sum` counters, `min` liveness, best-effort `sum` active-leases), auto-imported by the 009 playbook alongside `agent_run_breakdown.json`

### Removed

- 22 dead pipeline-tier-2 metrics (`agent_echo_*`, `agent_scout_*`, `agent_warden_*`, `agent_sandbox_*`, `agent_side_effect_outbox_*`, `agent_worker_allocator_leaks_total`, `agent_rate_limit_wait_ms_total`, and others) — consolidated into the `agent_duration_seconds` histogram and per-workspace counters
- `agent_gate_repair_loops_per_run` histogram — replaced by the composite `agent_duration_seconds` histogram added in 0.4.0

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Root run span (`run.execute`) in OTel traces — all agent/gate spans are children, queryable by `{run.id}` in Tempo
- Per-workspace Prometheus metrics: `zombie_agent_tokens_by_workspace_total`, `zombie_runs_completed_by_workspace_total`, `zombie_runs_blocked_by_workspace_total`, `zombie_gate_repair_loops_by_workspace_total`
- Gate repair loop distribution histogram: `zombie_gate_repair_loops_per_run` (buckets: 0,1,2,3,5,10)
- `GET /v1/workspaces/{id}/billing/summary` endpoint — billing breakdown by lifecycle event with period filter
- `zombiectl workspace billing` CLI command with `--period` and `--json` flags
- Grafana dashboard JSON (`docs/grafana/agent_run_breakdown.json`) — 7 panels, importable with template variables
- Grafana observability playbook (`playbooks/009_grafana_observability/001_playbook.md`) with gate scripts
- `zombie_workspace_metrics_overflow_total` counter for cardinality overflow alerting

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- `@usezombie/zombiectl` scoped npm package — published to npm registry with public access
- Complete OpenAPI 3.1 spec covering all 43 endpoints
- Post-release npm verification CI job: confirms published package installs and runs correctly
- Install-check PR gate: verifies npm install on every PR touching `zombiectl`
- OIDC secrets wired into CI deploy pipelines

### Changed

- Playbooks `M2_001` and `M4_002` marked done — credential gate and prod worker bootstrap verified
- `zombiectl` README rewritten with install instructions and pre-release caveat

### Fixed

- `smoke-post-deploy` workflow trigger restored with correct Production environment condition
- `zombiectl` glob `**` pattern now matches root-level files (replaced `bun Glob` with node-compatible implementation)
- npm publish job switched to bun runtime — resolves install failures in CI
- Website prebuild path corrected from `../../` to `../../../` for monorepo root layout

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- `zombiectl` CLI — warning banner + April 5 launch date display
- Release credential gate: all vault items verified before any deploy step runs
- `verify-runtime-compat` CI job: static binary validated against bookworm, trixie, and alpine before publish
- `PROD_WORKER_READY` guard on `deploy-prod-canary` — bare-metal worker fleet deploy gated until bootstrapped
- Fly machine-state verification step in prod deploy pipeline
- `cross-compile.yml` `workflow_call` trigger with `skip_build` input for caller-controlled build skipping
- `playbooks/007_worker_bootstrap_prod/001_playbook.md` — prod bare-metal worker bootstrap runbook

### Changed

- `docs/ZIG_STATIC_OPENSSL.md` moved to `docs/contributing/ZIG_STATIC_OPENSSL.md` and reformatted as reference blog post

### Fixed

- Fly machine-state check now only accepts `started` state — `stopped` machines are no longer treated as a successful deployment

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Initial release
- `zombied serve` — HTTP API + worker pipeline
- Agent pipeline: Echo → Scout → Warden
- Spec-to-PR delivery with retry loops
- GitHub App OAuth workspace integration
- OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `/openapi.json`
- Machine-readable agent discovery surfaces
