//! Test-only helper: ask the kernel for a free TCP port on 127.0.0.1.
//!
//! We bind a throwaway socket to port 0, let the kernel assign an unused
//! port, read it back with getsockname, then close. The caller passes that
//! port to httpz. httpz sets SO_REUSEADDR, so TIME_WAIT on our close doesn't
//! block its bind.
//!
//! There is a sub-millisecond TOCTOU window between our close and httpz's
//! bind where another process could steal the port. On a quiet test runner
//! this has never been observed. If it ever does become a real flake, the
//! next step is to hand httpz the already-bound fd instead of closing.
