//! fleet.runner_affinity — the per-zombie lease SLOT: the atomic claim, the
//! monotonic fencing source, and the sticky-routing hint, all on one row.
//!
//! `claim` is a single conditional UPSERT: it wins the zombie iff the slot is
//! free or its prior claim has expired (`leased_until < now`), bumping the
//! monotonic `fencing_seq` and recording the runner as the sticky hint. Exactly
//! one of N racing runners wins the row; losers get `.taken` and move on — and
//! crucially the claim precedes the event read, so a loser has consumed no
//! event (nothing is orphaned). `release` frees the slot at report, but is
//! token-guarded (`WHERE fencing_seq = token`) so a holder superseded by a
//! reclaim cannot free the current holder's slot; a dead runner never releases,
//! so its claim expires and another runner re-claims with a strictly higher
//! token. The report-time fence itself is a compare-and-swap in `service_report`
//! against this same `fencing_seq`.
//!
//! All functions run on a caller-supplied pooled connection (drained via
//! PgQuery / conn.exec).
