//! PgQuery — thin wrapper around pg.Result that auto-drains on deinit.
//!
//! Eliminates RULE PTR (q.*.next() anytype footgun) and the forgotten-drain
//! class of bugs by making cleanup unconditional via defer.
//!
//! Usage:
//!
//!   var q = PgQuery.from(try conn.query(sql, args));
//!   defer q.deinit();                  // auto-drains on any exit path
//!
//!   while (try q.next()) |row| { ... }
//!
//! Passing to helpers — use *PgQuery, never anytype:
//!
//!   fn helper(q: *PgQuery) !void {
//!       while (try q.next()) |row| { ... }
//!   }
