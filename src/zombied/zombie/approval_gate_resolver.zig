// Resolver-attribution prefixes for approval-gate resolutions.

// Every channel that calls approval_gate.resolve() writes the resolver
// identity as a `<channel>:<id>` string into core.zombie_approval_gates
// .resolved_by. The dashboard renders these verbatim — "already resolved
// by slack:webhook at 14:32" — so a rename of the channel string requires
// touching every writer. Centralising the literals here makes that mechanical:
// rename here, fix every consumer through the type system.
