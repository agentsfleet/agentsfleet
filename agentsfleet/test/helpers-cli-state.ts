// Shared test scaffolding for CLI integration tests.
//
// Five sibling *.integration.test.{js,ts} files were each carrying their
// own copy of (a) a Writable buffer that captures stdout/stderr, (b) a
// mkdtemp-based ZOMBIE_STATE_DIR scope guard, and (c) an authed variant
// of the same that pre-seeds credentials.json + workspaces.json so
// auth-required commands don't bounce off the auth guard. Hoisting them
// here cuts ~150 lines of duplication and makes the per-test surface
// uniform.
//
// IMPORTANT — serial-execution assumption:
//
// `withFreshStateDir` and `withAuthedStateDir` mutate
// `process.env.ZOMBIE_STATE_DIR` during the body of `fn` and restore in
// `finally`. This is safe only because `bun test` runs all files in a
// single worker process serially within a file, and (as of Bun 1.3.x)
// does not parallelize across files within a single `bun test` run.
//
// If that assumption ever changes — e.g., a `--parallel` flag is enabled,
// or a shard runner forks — two tests could trample each other's
// ZOMBIE_STATE_DIR mid-flight and one test would see the other's
// pre-seeded credentials. The clean fix at that point is to thread
// ZOMBIE_STATE_DIR through `runCli`'s `io` param (a one-line change in
// state.ts to read from caller-provided env first) instead of relying
// on the process-global. Until then this comment is the warning sign.
