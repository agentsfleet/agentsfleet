/**
 * WS-A.3 smoke — full auth wire: Clerk JWT + tenant bootstrap.
 *
 * Asserts:
 *   1. globalSetup ran (fail-fast didn't throw — implicit by reaching here).
 *   2. The fixture-JWT cache file exists with both fixture users' JWTs.
 *   3. signInAs(page, 'regular') mounts the __session cookie and Clerk
 *      middleware accepts the JWT (a navigation to '/' does NOT redirect to
 *      /sign-in).
 *   4. Post-bootstrap, the dashboard renders authenticated content for the
 *      signed-in fixture user (a marker like usezombie/Agents/Dashboard is
 *      visible on body, not just the marketing/sign-in page).
 *
 * Per-spec teardown for fixture rows (agents/credentials/events) lands with
 * the WS-C spec workstream — the bootstrap state itself is reused across
 * runs (idempotent on the user.created replay).
