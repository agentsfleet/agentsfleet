 * and must never be confused with this, which means "live right now").
 *
 * Sets `data-live` on the rendered element when `live` is true; the
 * `[data-live="true"]` rule in tokens.css drives the keyframe (2.4s ease-in-out
 * infinite, expanding glow ring in --pulse-glow). When `live` flips to
 * false the attribute is removed and the animation stops the same frame.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is honoured entirely in CSS — tokens.css
 * replaces the keyframe with a static glow ring at low opacity. Nothing
 * for the component to do.
