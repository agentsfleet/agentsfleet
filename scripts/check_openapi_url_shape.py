"""REST §1 — every URL path's final segment must be plural-noun shaped.

The rule (from docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md §1):
  - Plural noun for collections:        /products, /fleets/{id}/events
  - Path parameter at the leaf:         /products/{id}
  - Colon-noun operation (use sparingly): /approvals/{id}:approve

Anything else (bare verbs like /steer, /pause, /kill, /sync) violates §1.

This script is the mechanical gate so the rule survives context resets,
fleet swaps, and human commits — not just LLM judgment in the moment.

Source of truth: public/openapi.json (already bundled by `make openapi`).

Allowlists below are intentionally small and have justification comments.
Adding an entry is a code-review surface — every carve-out has a TODO
pointing at the spec that will rename the offending path.

Exit 0 if clean, non-zero with each violation listed.
