-- COMPLETE DATABASE TEARDOWN
-- Drops all user schemas and their contents
-- For PlanetScale (via psql) or local Docker containers

-- Drop every user-created schema with CASCADE (tables, views, indexes,
-- functions, triggers, etc.). Catalog-derived, NOT a hand-maintained list:
-- a static list silently rots the moment a migration adds a schema (the
-- `fleet` schema was added by the M80 runner cutover and a hardcoded list
-- left it standing, tripping the "0 objects remain" check below and blocking
-- the whole integration suite). The exclusion filter MUST match the
-- verification filter at the bottom so the two counts stay consistent.
