# M1_001: Playbook — Bootstrap

**Milestone:** M1
**Workstream:** 001
**Updated:** Mar 19, 2026
**Owner (1.0):** Human — one-time per startup
**Owner (2.0):** Agent — executes after 1.0 handoff

Reusable across startups. Replace `ZMB` vault prefix, domain names, and service names per project.

---

## 1.0 Human Prerequisites

Create accounts and generate one root API key per service. Hand off to agent when done.

### 1.1 Create Accounts

- [ ] **GitHub** — create org + repo
- [ ] **1Password Teams** — create team, create two vaults (names become `VAULT_DEV` and `VAULT_PROD` GitHub variables); create service account (e.g. `<project>-ci`) with access to both vaults; copy its token
- [ ] **Vercel** — sign up, connect GitHub repo, create projects per the spec
- [ ] **Cloudflare** — add domains, set nameservers
- [ ] **Codecov** — connect GitHub repo
- [ ] **npm** — create org
- [ ] **Fly.io** — sign up at fly.io (use Google/GitHub). Add a payment method (required even on free tier). Install `flyctl` locally: `curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh`. Run `fly auth login` (browser OAuth, one-time per machine). All service setup is agent-executed via CLI (see M2_002 §2.0).
- [ ] **Cloudflare Tunnel** — no separate sign-up needed; tunnels are created under your existing Cloudflare account. Install `cloudflared` locally (`mise install cloudflared` or `brew install cloudflared`). Run `cloudflared tunnel login` (browser OAuth, one-time per machine — selects which Cloudflare zone to authorize). Agent then creates tunnels, stores credentials in vault, and routes DNS via `cloudflared` CLI (see M2_002 §2.4).

### 1.2 Generate Root API Keys

One key per service:

| Service | What to generate | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1Password | Service account token for `agentsfleet-ci` | 1Password → Service Accounts |
| Vercel | Account API token (Full Account scope) | Vercel → Account Settings → Tokens |
| Vercel (`agentsfleet-website`) | Deployment Protection bypass secret | Vercel → project → Settings → Deployment Protection |
| Vercel (`agentsfleet-agents-dev`) | Deployment Protection bypass secret | Vercel → project → Settings → Deployment Protection |
| Vercel (`agentsfleet-app`) | Deployment Protection bypass secret | Vercel → project → Settings → Deployment Protection |
| Cloudflare | API token with Zone:Edit + DNS:Edit + Transform Rules:Edit (all zones) | CF → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token |
| Fly.io | Deploy token (org-scoped) | `fly tokens create deploy -o <org>` → copy output |
| Clerk (DEV instance) | Publishable key + Secret key | Clerk dashboard → DEV instance → API Keys |
| Clerk (PROD instance) | Publishable key + Secret key | Clerk dashboard → PROD instance → API Keys |
| GitHub App | App ID + PEM private key | GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App |
| npm | Granular publish token | npmjs.org → Access Tokens |
| Codecov | Repo token | Codecov → repo settings |
| gitleaks | License key | gitleaks.io |

### 1.3a Generate Encryption Master Key

Generate a 32-byte (64 hex char) AES-256 key for at-rest secret encryption. Run once per environment:

```bash
# DEV key
openssl rand -hex 32

# PROD key (run separately — must differ from DEV)
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Store each output as `credential` in its respective vault item (`encryption-master-key`). Never reuse between environments.

### 1.3b Generate Auth Pepper Keys

Two independent 32-byte (64 hex char) CSPRNG values per environment. One is the keyed-HMAC pepper used to defeat offline brute-force of the CLI-login verification code; the other is the keyed-HMAC pepper used to pseudonymize `session_id` in the auth-audit log sink. Both are loaded by `agentsfleetd` at boot via `src/state/vault.zig` and held in process memory only — never written to disk, never logged. Boot fails fast if either is missing.

```bash
# DEV — session-code HMAC pepper
openssl rand -hex 32   # → store in op://$VAULT_DEV/auth-session-code-pepper/credential

# DEV — audit-log HMAC pepper
openssl rand -hex 32   # → store in op://$VAULT_DEV/audit-log-pepper/credential

# PROD — session-code HMAC pepper (must differ from DEV)
openssl rand -hex 32   # → store in op://$VAULT_PROD/auth-session-code-pepper/credential

# PROD — audit-log HMAC pepper (must differ from DEV)
openssl rand -hex 32   # → store in op://$VAULT_PROD/audit-log-pepper/credential
```

**Rotation:** rotating `auth-session-code-pepper` invalidates every in-flight CLI login session (their HMACs no longer match). Cheap because sessions are 5-minute-TTL — drain old sessions by waiting 5+ minutes between provisioning the new pepper and cutting the API process over. Rotating `audit-log-pepper` breaks cross-event correlation for past sessions but does not affect security (a different pepper protects the code itself).

**Provisioning is manual:** run the four `openssl rand` commands above and store each value with `op item create` (or `op item edit` to update). There is no helper script — `agentsfleetd` boot fails fast if either pepper is missing, so verify both items exist in both vaults before handoff.

### 1.3c Provision E2E Fixture Email Identities

The Playwright e2e suite under `ui/packages/app/tests/e2e/` and the live CLI acceptance suite under `cli/test/acceptance/lifecycle-after-login.spec.ts` authenticate against Clerk DEV using two long-lived test users. Credentials live in Vault so tests read them at suite setup without hardcoding. DEV vault only — the e2e suite never runs against production.

```bash
# 1. In the Clerk DEV dashboard, create two test users:
#    - regular@agentsfleet.dev (regular tenant member role)
#    - admin@agentsfleet.dev   (tenant admin role)
# 2. Generate a strong password for each: `openssl rand -base64 24` (or similar).
# 3. Store both as separate 1Password items in the DEV vault:
#    op://$VAULT_DEV/e2e-fixtures-email/regular  → fields: email, password
#    op://$VAULT_DEV/e2e-fixtures-email/admin    → fields: email, password
```

PROD vault: **not required**. If a future spec adds prod-canary smoke tests, that spec authors the prod entries separately.

### 1.3 Hand Off to Agent

Give the agent:
- The `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` (1Password service account token)
- All other raw API keys from 1.2

Hand-off message:

> "Milestone 1 complete. Here are the root API keys: [paste keys]. Store them in 1Password vaults `ZMB_CD_PROD` / `ZMB_CD_DEV` per `playbooks/founding/01_bootstrap/001_playbook.md §2.0`, including the new entries from §1.3b (auth peppers) and §1.3c (e2e fixture emails). Then run `./playbooks/founding/02_preflight/00_gate.sh` and proceed with `playbooks/founding/02_preflight/001_playbook.md`."

---

## 2.0 Agent Steps

Agent executes these steps immediately after receiving the hand-off from 1.3.

### 2.1 Store Keys in 1Password Vaults

See [preflight playbook](../02_preflight/001_playbook.md) §1.1 and §1.2 for the full vault inventory (items, fields, and consumers).

Create each item listed there. Value sources for items that require human provisioning:

| Item | Where to get the value |
|---|---|
| `cloudflare-api-token` | Cloudflare dashboard → API Tokens |
| `npm-publish-token` | npmjs.com → Access Tokens → Granular (automation) |
| `vercel-bypass-*` | Vercel → Project → Deployment Protection → Bypass |
| `vercel-api-token` | Vercel Account Settings → Tokens |
| `posthog-{dev,prod}` | PostHog project → Settings → Project API Key |
| `clerk-{dev,prod}` | Clerk dashboard → API Keys (publishable + secret); JWKS URL and issuer derived from Clerk domain |
| `github-app` | GitHub App → Settings → App ID + Generate private key |
| `encryption-master-key` | `openssl rand -hex 32` (DEV and PROD must differ) |
| `auth-session-code-pepper` | `openssl rand -hex 32` (per §1.3b — DEV and PROD must differ) |
| `audit-log-pepper` | `openssl rand -hex 32` (per §1.3b — DEV and PROD must differ) |
| `e2e-fixtures-email/regular` | Clerk DEV user + `openssl rand -base64 24` password (per §1.3c — DEV vault only) |
| `e2e-fixtures-email/admin` | Clerk DEV user + `openssl rand -base64 24` password (per §1.3c — DEV vault only) |
| `agentsfleetd-prod-server-*` | Created on server provision |

### 2.2 Set GitHub Secrets and Variables

GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions:

**Secrets** (sensitive — never visible after saving):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` | 1Password service account token |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Codecov repo token |
| `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` | gitleaks license key |

> Only these three live in GitHub as secrets. All other secrets are fetched from 1Password at runtime via `op://` URIs.

**Variables** (non-sensitive — visible, used to parameterise vault names):

| Variable | Value | Where defined |
|---|---|---|
| `VAULT_DEV` | e.g. `ZMB_CD_DEV` | name you chose when creating the vault |
| `VAULT_PROD` | e.g. `ZMB_CD_PROD` | name you chose when creating the vault |

> Workflows reference these as `${{ vars.VAULT_DEV }}` / `${{ vars.VAULT_PROD }}` — no hardcoded vault names anywhere in CI. Scripts fall back to `ZMB_CD_DEV` / `ZMB_CD_PROD` if the env var is not set locally.

### 2.3 GHCR Package Permissions

After the first CI push to GHCR (triggered automatically on the first merge to `main`), set the package visibility:

1. Go to `https://github.com/orgs/<org>/packages/container/<service>/settings`
2. **Change visibility → Public** — Fly.io and any consumer can pull without credentials
3. **Manage Actions access → Add repository** → select the repo → set role to **Write**

This is a one-time human step. GitHub has no API endpoint to change org package visibility — it must be done in the UI. Once public, it persists across all future CI pushes.

> **Why public?** The image contains only the compiled binary. All secrets come from env vars at runtime. There is no secret in the image.

### 2.3a Fly.io — API Service (Agent-executed via CLI)

**Architecture:**
```
Cloudflare Edge (api-dev.agentsfleet.net)
    │ Cloudflare Tunnel — encrypted, origin-shielded
    ▼
cloudflared-dev (Fly app, 2 machines for HA)
    │ Fly private network / 6PN (internal only, no public port)
    ▼
agentsfleetd-dev.internal:3000  ← Fly anycast LB (automatic)
    ├── Machine 1 (iad, shared-cpu-1x 512MB)
    └── Machine 2 (iad, shared-cpu-1x 512MB)  ← auto-scaled up to N

agentsfleet-runner (host-resident daemon on a bare-metal node — NOT a Fly app)
    └── leases work over HTTPS, sandboxes in bubblewrap, control plane over Tailscale
        (bootstrapped via 06_/07_runner_bootstrap_*; CI-deployed via deploy-dev.yml)
```

**Why Fly.io:**
- No `*.fly.dev` public domain created when `[http_service]` is omitted — only the Cloudflare Tunnel is the ingress. True origin shielding.
- Built-in anycast load balancing across all machines — no LB config.
- Auto-scaling: set `min_machines_running` + `auto_stop_machines` in `fly.toml`.
- Static outbound IP included — needed for PlanetScale/Upstash IP allowlisting.
- `iad` region co-locates with PlanetScale `aws-us-east-2` → ~5ms DB latency.

Agent executes via Fly CLI (see M2_002 §2.0 for full steps):

```bash
# Authenticate (human does fly auth login once; agent uses deploy token from vault)
export FLY_API_TOKEN=$(op read "op://$VAULT_DEV/fly-api-token/credential")

# Create apps (API + tunnel connector — execution runs on the bare-metal
# agentsfleet-runner, not a Fly app; see 06_/07_runner_bootstrap_*)
fly apps create agentsfleetd-dev       --org <org>
fly apps create cloudflared-dev   --org <org>

# Set secrets from vault
fly secrets set \
  DATABASE_URL_API="$(op read 'op://$VAULT_DEV/planetscale-dev/api-connection-string')" \
  DATABASE_URL_MIGRATOR="$(op read 'op://$VAULT_DEV/planetscale-dev/migrator-connection-string')" \
  REDIS_URL_API="$(op read 'op://$VAULT_DEV/upstash-dev/api-url')" \
  ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY="$(op read 'op://$VAULT_DEV/encryption-master-key/credential')" \
  GITHUB_APP_ID="$(op read 'op://$VAULT_DEV/github-app/app-id')" \
  GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="$(op read 'op://$VAULT_DEV/github-app/private-key')" \
  OIDC_JWKS_URL="https://winning-wombat-65.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json" \
  OIDC_ISSUER="https://winning-wombat-65.clerk.accounts.dev" \
  --app agentsfleetd-dev

# Deploy from GHCR
fly deploy --app agentsfleetd-dev --image ghcr.io/agentsfleet/agentsfleetd:dev-latest

# Scale to 2 machines for HA
fly scale count 2 --app agentsfleetd-dev
```

CI triggers redeployments via `fly deploy --image` using the deploy token. Store in vault and set GitHub Actions vars:
- `fly-api-token` → `ZMB_CD_DEV` and `ZMB_CD_PROD` vaults
- `FLY_API_TOKEN` → GitHub Actions secret (or load from 1Password via OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN)

### 2.3b Cloudflare Tunnel — Origin Shield (Agent-executed)

Cloudflare Tunnel routes all traffic from `api-dev.agentsfleet.net` → Fly private network. No public port on Fly. No bypass possible.

```bash
# Create tunnel (stores credentials locally; agent saves to vault)
cloudflared tunnel create agentsfleetd-dev
# Output: tunnel ID e.g. abc123...

# Store tunnel credentials in vault
op item create --vault "$VAULT_DEV" --title cloudflare-tunnel-dev \
  --category "API Credential" \
  "credential=$(cat ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json | base64)"

# Create DNS CNAME → tunnel (origin-shielded, no public Fly endpoint)
cloudflared tunnel route dns agentsfleetd-dev api-dev.agentsfleet.net
```

`cloudflared` config deployed as a Fly app connects to `agentsfleetd-dev.internal:3000` via Fly's private 6PN network. The Fly app has no `[http_service]` — no public endpoint is created.

Cloudflare SSL/TLS mode: **Full (Strict)**. No Transform Rules needed — the tunnel handles routing.

### 2.3c Cloudflare DNS — Managed Records

For non-API DNS (website, app, etc.) — agent sets CNAME records via Cloudflare API:

```bash
CF_TOKEN=$(op read "op://$VAULT_PROD/cloudflare-api-token/credential")
ZONE_ID=<from 2.6 below>

# These point to Vercel (not Fly — API traffic goes via tunnel)
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/dns_records" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"CNAME","name":"app","content":"cname.vercel-dns.com","proxied":true,"ttl":1}'
```

Cloudflare API token needs: Zone:Edit + DNS:Edit + Transform Rules:Edit permissions.

### 2.6 Cloudflare — Zone Discovery

```bash
# VAULT_PROD must be set in your environment (or export it first)
CF_TOKEN=$(op read "op://$VAULT_PROD/cloudflare-api-token/credential")
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_TOKEN" \
  https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones | jq '.result[] | {name, id}'
```

### 2.7 Vercel — Set Env Vars

Agent reads project IDs and API token from 1Password, then upserts via the Vercel v10 env API (`POST /v10/projects/{id}/env?upsert=true`). Use the script — the table is reference, the script is the source of truth:

```bash
./playbooks/founding/01_bootstrap/02_vercel_env.sh           # apply
./playbooks/founding/01_bootstrap/02_vercel_env.sh --check   # read-only diff, exits 1 on drift
```

After applying, **trigger a fresh redeploy per project without build cache** — `VITE_*` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` are inlined at build time, so existing deployments keep stale (or empty) values until they rebuild.

**`agentsfleet-app`:**

| Variable | Preview | Production |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://api-dev.agentsfleet.net` | `https://api.agentsfleet.net` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk DEV publishable key | Clerk PROD publishable key |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk DEV secret key | Clerk PROD secret key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` | `op://$VAULT_DEV/posthog-dev/credential` | `op://$VAULT_PROD/posthog-prod/credential` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` | `https://us.i.posthog.com` | `https://us.i.posthog.com` |

**`agentsfleet-agents-dev`** and **`agentsfleet-website`:**

| Variable | Preview | Production |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_APP_BASE_URL` | `https://app.dev.agentsfleet.net` | `https://app.agentsfleet.net` |
| `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` | `op://$VAULT_DEV/posthog-dev/credential` | `op://$VAULT_PROD/posthog-prod/credential` |
| `VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` | `https://us.i.posthog.com` | `https://us.i.posthog.com` |

**`agentsfleetd` + `agentsfleet`:**

| Variable | Preview | Production |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | `op://$VAULT_DEV/posthog-dev/credential` | `op://$VAULT_PROD/posthog-prod/credential` |
| `AGENTSFLEET_POSTHOG_KEY` | `op://$VAULT_DEV/posthog-dev/credential` | `op://$VAULT_PROD/posthog-prod/credential` |

> Code defaults `*_POSTHOG_HOST` to `https://us.i.posthog.com` when unset, so the explicit row is documentation, not strictly required on US cloud. If you ever migrate PostHog to EU or self-host, the `*_HOST` row becomes load-bearing — update it here and re-run the script.

---

## 3.0 Handoff to Milestone 2

Once 2.4 is verified, agent runs `./playbooks/founding/02_preflight/00_gate.sh` (`founding/02_preflight`) to confirm all vault items are present before executing `playbooks/founding/03_priming_infra/001_playbook.md`.

All vault items the agent will need are listed in `playbooks/founding/02_preflight/001_playbook.md §1.0` and `§4.0`. Review that list now and create any missing items in 1Password before the handoff — it avoids mid-execution failures.

---

## 4.0 Reuse for a New Startup

1. Choose vault names for the new project (e.g. `ABC_CD_DEV`, `ABC_CD_PROD`)
2. Set GitHub repo variables `VAULT_DEV` / `VAULT_PROD` to those names
3. Replace domain names, Vercel project names, service account name in this doc
4. Milestone 1 checklist is otherwise identical — same services, same key types

**Pattern: humans own identity, agents own configuration.**
