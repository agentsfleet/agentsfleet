# Playbooks

Canonical layout uses ordered directories so agents can run lexically from `001` upward.

> **Architecture rationale:** see [`architecture/`](./architecture/) for why every public-facing service in this project sits behind a Cloudflare Tunnel — the WHY behind the operational steps in `001_bootstrap`, `003_priming_infra`, and the deploy playbooks.

## Playbooks vs Gates

**Playbooks** (`playbooks/NNN_name/001_playbook.md`) are human-readable runbooks. They describe:

- Who does what (human vs agent)
- Step-by-step procedures with context and rationale
- Acceptance criteria per step
- Dependencies and prerequisites

Playbooks are documentation. They are NOT executable.

**Gates** (`playbooks/NNN_name/00_gate.sh` + numbered sections) are machine-executable verification scripts. They:

- Validate that a playbook's acceptance criteria are met
- Run in CI as pipeline prerequisites (e.g. `deploy-dev.yml` runs `002_preflight/00_gate.sh` as job 0)
- Run locally by agents to verify state before proceeding
- Exit non-zero on any failure — fail loud, fail all items (not just the first)

Gates are executable. They are NOT documentation.

## Gate Script Convention

Each gate lives inside its ordered playbook directory.

- `00_gate.sh` — dispatcher. Globs `01_*.sh`, `02_*.sh`, etc. and runs them in order.
- `01_name.sh`, `02_name.sh` — numbered section scripts. Two-digit prefix, descriptive snake_case name.
- All scripts are `set -euo pipefail`, print per check, exit 1 if any check fails.
- Environment: `VAULT_DEV`, `VAULT_PROD`, `ENV` (all/dev/prod).
- Shared helpers live in `playbooks/lib/common.sh`.
- If a gate reads from vault, it must require explicit approval via `ALLOW_VAULT_READS=1`.

## When to Add a Gate

Add a gate when:

- A playbook has acceptance criteria that can be verified programmatically
- CI needs to block on a precondition (credential check, host readiness, service health)
- An agent needs to verify state before executing the next playbook step

Not every playbook needs a gate. 001_bootstrap is human-only with manual verification.
