# Playbooks

Two tiers, by intent:

- **`founding/`** — the **sequential** spine you run **once, in order**, to stand a usezombie platform up from nothing. Run lexically from `01_bootstrap` upward; each step declares its predecessor as a prerequisite.
- **`operations/`** — **on-demand** runbooks with **no implied order**: rotate a credential, set up observability, tear an environment down. Named by what they do, not numbered, because they are not a sequence. Destructive teardowns are isolated under `operations/teardown/`.

> The old flat `001…015` numbering implied a single sequence that did not exist — teardowns, CI image builds, and post-deploy admin setup were numbered as if they followed the deploy steps. This split makes the founding path legible and keeps ops runbooks from masquerading as founding steps.

> **Architecture rationale:** see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for why every public-facing service in this project sits behind a Cloudflare Tunnel — the WHY behind the operational steps in `founding/01_bootstrap`, `founding/03_priming_infra`, and the deploy playbooks.

## Playbooks vs Gates

**Playbooks** (`playbooks/<tier>/<name>/001_playbook.md`) are human-readable runbooks. They describe:

- Who does what (human vs agent)
- Step-by-step procedures with context and rationale
- Acceptance criteria per step
- Dependencies and prerequisites

Playbooks are documentation. They are NOT executable.

**Gates** (`playbooks/<tier>/<name>/00_gate.sh` + numbered sections) are machine-executable verification scripts. They:

- Validate that a playbook's acceptance criteria are met
- Run in CI as pipeline prerequisites (e.g. `deploy-dev.yml` runs `founding/02_preflight/00_gate.sh` as job 0)
- Run locally by agents to verify state before proceeding
- Exit non-zero on any failure — fail loud, fail all items (not just the first)

Gates are executable. They are NOT documentation.

## Gate Script Convention

Each gate lives inside its playbook directory.

- `00_gate.sh` — dispatcher. Globs `01_*.sh`, `02_*.sh`, etc. and runs them in order.
- `01_name.sh`, `02_name.sh` — numbered section scripts. Two-digit prefix, descriptive snake_case name.
- All scripts are `set -euo pipefail`, print per check, exit 1 if any check fails.
- Environment: `VAULT_DEV`, `VAULT_PROD`, `ENV` (all/dev/prod).
- Shared helpers live in `playbooks/lib/common.sh`.
- **Vault-read approval is scoped by run mode:**
  - **Interactive, operator-run gates** that read vault require explicit approval via `ALLOW_VAULT_READS=1` (e.g. `operations/ip_allowlisting`).
  - **Unattended gates run by CI** (`founding/02_preflight`, `founding/06_runner_bootstrap_dev`) are exempt — reading vault to verify presence is their sole purpose and CI cannot prompt for approval.
  - **Destructive teardown gates** (`operations/teardown/*`) do not use `ALLOW_VAULT_READS`; they carry a stronger guard — `ALLOW_<RESOURCE>_TEARDOWN=1` plus typed-environment confirmation.

## When to Add a Gate

Add a gate when:

- A playbook has acceptance criteria that can be verified programmatically
- CI needs to block on a precondition (credential check, host readiness, service health)
- An agent needs to verify state before executing the next playbook step

Not every playbook needs a gate. `founding/01_bootstrap` is human-only with manual verification.
