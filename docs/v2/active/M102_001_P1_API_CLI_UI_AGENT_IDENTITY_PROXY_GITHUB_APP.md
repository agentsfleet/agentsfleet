# M102_001: Agent identity proxy — a workspace connects GitHub once, fleets mint short-lived App tokens on demand through one config-driven broker

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M102
**Workstream:** 001
**Date:** Jun 26, 2026
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Priority:** P1 — operator-facing: one-click "Connect GitHub" replaces the hand-pasted long-lived Personal Access Token (PAT); the broker forestalls a per-connector minter junk drawer in `agentsfleetd`.
**Categories:** API, CLI, UI
**Batch:** B1 — backend mint wire (§1–§4) before the UI-first connect surface (§5–§6); CLI ops + docs sweep (§7–§8) ride after.
**Branch:** feat/m102-agent-identity-proxy
**Depends on:** none hard. **Supersedes** M99_001 (DEFERRED — "re-spec under the agent-identity-proxy framing"); composes with M98_001 (vault UI).
**Provenance:** agent-generated (interactive CTO design session with Indy, Jun 25–26 2026; reborn from M99_001 with two refinements — App-level webhook ingress + explicit grant/approval placement). Re-confirm at PLAN.
**Test Baseline:** unit=2145 integration=206

> **Agent identity, honest scope.** The GitHub App *installation* IS the agent's non-human identity here: fleets act as the App (scoped, revocable, attributable to the App — not a human PAT). Per-fleet cryptographic identity / Agent Auth wire-format alignment is the v3 layer and is Out of Scope.

**Canonical architecture:** `docs/AUTH.md` (credential boundary — secrets ride the lease, the App private key is platform-side, the sandbox child holds no control-plane key) + `docs/architecture/data_flow.md` §B/§C + `docs/architecture/runner_fleet.md` (the `agt_r` plane). This spec adds a daemon-side broker + a child→runner→daemon mint request on the existing `agt_r` plane; **it introduces no new trust plane.**

---

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. `docs/v2/done/M99_001_P1_API_CLI_UI_CONNECTORS_CREDENTIAL_BROKER.md` — the deferred predecessor; its Interfaces/Failure-Modes/Invariants are the blueprint. **Do not edit it.**
2. `docs/AUTH.md` §"credential boundary", §"Runner token", §"Webhook auth" — the boundary, the `agt_r` plane (`/v1/runners/me/*`), the existing GitHub webhook. **Auth-flow file — read before any connect/callback/token-mint code.**
3. `src/agentsfleetd/fleet/secrets_resolve.zig` + `src/lib/contract/execution_policy.zig` — `resolveSecretsMap` is what generalizes from "load static JSON at lease" to "resolve-or-mint on demand."
4. `src/runner/engine/runtime/policy_http_request.zig` + `src/runner/engine/tool_bridge.zig` — where `${secrets.X.field}` is substituted at the tool boundary; the substitution step gains a mintable-kind path.
5. `docs/v2/reviews/m102-doc-shape-review.md` — the adversarial doc-shape review (C1–C9) the §8 sweep absorbs.

## PR Intent & comprehension handshake

- **PR title (eventual):** `feat(m102): agent identity proxy — GitHub App connector + on-demand token mint`
- **Intent (one sentence):** a workspace clicks "Connect GitHub" once, and from then on its fleets mint a short-lived, workspace-scoped GitHub App installation token **on demand at the moment a tool needs it** — through one config-driven broker whose next connector is a descriptor, never a new daemon branch.
- **Handshake (agent fills at PLAN):** restate intent; list `ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:`. Confirm: (a) the `agt_r` plane hosts `…/credentials/mint`; (b) the child→runner local-pipe request shape; (c) GitHub App registration ownership + admin-vault key storage; (d) the App-level webhook (one URL) routed by `installation_id`, not a per-fleet URL. A `[?]` blocks EXECUTE.

---

## Product Clarity

1. **Successful user moment** — connect GitHub once at 11:00; next day a teammate opens a Pull Request (PR), the fleet wakes, mints a fresh token at that instant, reads the diff, posts a review; 6h later the operator steers "check PR #500" and it mints again on the spot. The operator never saw a token, a webhook URL, or a paste field.
2. **Preserved behaviour** — static custom secrets still resolve; the inbound webhook Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) path still verifies; model routing is untouched; a fleet with no connector behaves as today.
3. **Optimal-way check** — on-demand mint through a broker is the most direct path: the token is born at use, so idle time and trigger source stop mattering. The gap to perfect (a generic OAuth-refresh driver, per-fleet identity) is deferred — the abstraction lands now, depth later.
4. **Rebuild-vs-iterate** — iterate. `secrets_resolve` + the `agt_r` plane + the tool-boundary substitution all exist; this generalizes them. Verdict: targeted refactor (full rationale below).
5. **What we build** — a daemon-side `CredentialBroker` + config-driven driver registry; the `github_app` driver; a child→runner→daemon mint request; tool-boundary resolve-or-mint; the GitHub App connect/reconnect surface (UI-first) + the App-level webhook ingress routed by `installation_id`; grant + approval placement; CLI connector ops + vault surfacing; the docs sweep.
6. **What we do NOT build** — the `oauth_refresh` driver (Slack/Zoho/Jira/Linear stay "Planned", bridged by custom secrets); per-fleet cryptographic identity / Agent Auth wire format; Stripe Agentic Commerce Protocol; exact-action approval-hash binding (reuse the coarse integration grant); a standalone credentials microservice; rotation automation beyond mint-on-demand.
7. **Fit** — compounds with the M98 vault UI, the `agt_r` lease envelope, and the existing approval inbox; must not destabilize the sandbox env-allowlist, the inbound webhook verifier, or static-secret resolution.
8. **Surface order — UI-first** (Indy's call): the "Connect GitHub" button + approval inbox lead. The mint wire (§1–§4) is backend-first because every surface depends on it; CLI ops (§7) fast-follow. Divergence from CLI-first is deliberate — connect is a browser-native OAuth consent, and approvals already live in the UI.
9. **Dashboard restraint** — only GitHub shows a live "Connect"; Slack/Zoho/Linear render "Planned" with the custom-secret hint; no token, webhook URL, App key, or secret is ever displayed; connector state is real, never fabricated.
10. **Confused-user next step** — a fleet that can't reach GitHub shows a typed "Reconnect GitHub" state (CLI JSON + UI), never a silent 401; a user wanting Slack reads the inline custom-secret hint and self-serves.

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`** — **RULE CFG** (driver registry + credential kinds are data, never per-integration branches — the core), **VLT** (App key / minted tokens never logged or returned), **PRI/NTP** (treat connector + webhook inputs as hostile), **ECL** (reconnect / mint-failed / unknown-integration are typed classes), **EMS** (standard error structure), **TGU** (tagged-union mint result), **JCL** (CLI JSON contract), **UFS** (kind ids `"github_app"`/`"static"`, mint route, `${secrets.…}` shape → named constants shared verbatim with tests), **NDC/NLR/ORP**.
- **`docs/AUTH.md`** — auth-flow: mirror the boundary (App key platform-side, sandbox holds no control-plane key); reuse the `agt_r` plane + the webhook verifier.
- **`dispatch/write_zig.md`** — tagged-union results, multi-step `errdefer`, pg-drain, file ≤350 / fn ≤50, cross-compile both linux targets.
- **`dispatch/write_ts_adhere_bun.md`** — TS FILE SHAPE per new component, primitive substitution, DESIGN TOKEN gate (UI rows).
- **`docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`** — the mint + App-ingress routes live under `src/agentsfleetd/http/handlers/**`.
- No schema Data Definition Language anticipated → handle + webhook secret ride existing vault JSON; `docs/SCHEMA_CONVENTIONS.md` applies only if an `installation_id ↔ workspace` index proves necessary.

## Applicable Gates

| Gate | Fires? | Satisfaction strategy |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| ZIG GATE | yes — broker, driver, mint endpoint, channel, ingress | tagged-union results; `errdefer`; cross-compile both linux targets |
| PUB / Struct-Shape | yes — `CredentialBroker`, `Driver`, mint req/resp | shape verdict per new pub surface; tagged-union mint result |
| File & Function Length (≤350/≤50/≤70) | yes — broker + drivers | one file per driver; broker dispatch table extracted |
| UFS (repeated/semantic literals) | yes — kind ids, mint route, placeholder shape, error strings | named constants in one module per side; tests import them |
| UI Substitution / DESIGN TOKEN | yes — Connect/reconnect rows | design-system primitives; theme tokens only |
| LOGGING / ERROR REGISTRY (`UZ-XXX-NNN`) | yes — connect, mint, reconnect-required | register `UZ-GH-*` / `UZ-CRED-*` + `hint()`; no secret in any frame |
| SCHEMA | no — handle + secret ride vault JSON | — |

---

## Overview

**Goal (testable):** `CredentialBroker.mint(workspace_id, integration, scope)` returns a short-lived `{token, expires_at}` via a config-driven driver registry (`github_app` first); a sandboxed child obtains that token **on demand** by asking its runner, which forwards over the `agt_r` plane; the App private key never leaves the daemon; `${secrets.github.token}` transparently triggers the mint at the tool boundary; the GitHub App's single webhook routes to the right fleet by `installation_id`; and adding a connector adds a descriptor with **zero** new branches in the mint dispatch.

**Problem:** GitHub fleets need a hand-pasted PAT (long-lived, broad, at-rest) and the user must manually register a per-repo webhook. The obvious fix — mint per connector inline in `agentsfleetd` — doesn't scale: each integration bolts bespoke minting into the daemon.

**Solution summary:** a daemon-side broker with a data-driven driver registry mints short-lived workspace-scoped tokens; the child fetches them on demand through the runner so idle time and trigger source stop mattering; the App key stays platform-side; the App's single webhook is routed internally by `installation_id`; the existing verifier and `secrets_map` resolution are reused. GitHub ships as the first driver + connector; the next is a descriptor.

---

## Prior-Art / Reference Implementations

- **Backend** → generalize `secrets_resolve.zig` (name→vault-JSON) into resolve-or-mint; mirror `resolveActiveProvider`'s just-in-time, never-persisted key handling (M80_009) for the minted token's lifecycle (`secureZero` after use). **Channel** → the `agt_r` plane is the existing daemon↔runner wire; the mint route is one more on it. **Pattern** → workload-identity / instance-metadata.
- **CLI** → the "7 Pillars" (handler purity, output-as-a-service, structured-JSON errors). **UI** → M98 vault Integrations group + design-system primitives. **API** → `docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` + nearest `src/agentsfleetd/http/handlers/` handler.

## Decomposition & alternatives (patch vs refactor)

- **Chosen shape:** eight Sections. The broker + driver + on-demand channel + tool-boundary path (§1–§4) are the foundation; the App connect surface + ingress (§5), grant/approval placement (§6), CLI (§7), and docs sweep (§8) ride on top. The driver registry is the refactor that prevents the per-connector junk drawer.
- **Alternatives considered:** (a) long-lived PAT per connector — rejected: at-rest broad token; (b) mint per connector inline — rejected: Indy's caveat, doesn't scale; (c) standalone credentials microservice — rejected: a new trust plane the `agt_r` plane already fronts; (d) mint-at-lease only — rejected: fails steer-after-6h-no-trigger; (e) exact-action approval-hash binding now — deferred, reuse the coarse grant.
- **Patch-vs-refactor verdict:** **targeted refactor** — generalize the existing secrets path into a broker with pluggable drivers, plus one local-pipe round-trip and one App ingress. The `oauth_refresh` driver, per-fleet identity, and exact-action approval are named follow-ups.

---

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — Credential broker core + config-driven driver registry
One mint interface dispatching through a registry keyed by credential-kind. **Implementation default:** the registry is a data table (kind → descriptor), so a new connector is a registration, not a `switch` arm (RULE CFG). The broker caches a minted token until near `expires_at`.
- **Dimension 1.1** — `mint(workspace, integration, scope)` returns `{token, expires_at}` via registry dispatch → `test_broker_dispatches_by_kind`
- **Dimension 1.2** — adding a driver is a descriptor; the mint hot path has no per-integration branch → `test_driver_registry_is_data_driven`
- **Dimension 1.3** — a cached token within validity is reused; near-expiry re-mints → `test_broker_caches_until_expiry`
- **Dimension 1.4** — an unconfigured integration → typed `unknown_integration`, no mint → `test_broker_unknown_integration_errors`

### §2 — `github_app` driver
Sign a GitHub App token with the platform-held private key, exchange it at GitHub for a ≤1h installation access token. **Default:** the App key + app id resolve from the platform/admin vault only.
- **Dimension 2.1** — valid installation handle → installation token with a near-future `expires_at` → `test_github_app_mints_installation_token`
- **Dimension 2.2** — uninstalled/revoked → typed `reconnect_required` (`UZ-GH-*`), no token → `test_github_app_revoked_reconnect`
- **Dimension 2.3** — the App key never appears in any `ExecutionPolicy`/`secrets_map`/log/frame → `test_github_app_key_never_leaves_broker`

### §3 — On-demand mint channel (child → runner → daemon)
The child requests a token from its runner over the local pipe; the runner forwards to the broker over the `agt_r` plane. **The workspace is derived from the lease server-side — a child-supplied workspace id is ignored.**
- **Dimension 3.1** — child request → runner forwards → short-lived token returned → `test_child_requests_token_via_runner`
- **Dimension 3.2** — a forged workspace id resolves to the lease's workspace only → `test_mint_scoped_to_lease_workspace`
- **Dimension 3.3** — a long-idle session with no external trigger mints a fresh token at the tool call → `test_on_demand_mint_no_trigger`

### §4 — Tool-boundary transparent resolve-or-mint
When `PolicyHttpRequestTool` resolves `${secrets.<integration>.token}` for a **mintable** kind, it fetches via the channel instead of a static value; substitution stays at the tool boundary. **Static kinds resolve as today.**
- **Dimension 4.1** — mintable `${secrets.github.token}` triggers a broker fetch, substituted only at dispatch → `test_bridge_mints_on_placeholder`
- **Dimension 4.2** — the partial-substitution guard holds: residual `${secrets.` aborts the call → `test_bridge_refuses_partial_sub`
- **Dimension 4.3** — a static-kind credential resolves with no mint (unchanged path) → `test_bridge_static_unchanged`

### §5 — GitHub App connect surface (UI-first) + App-level webhook ingress
A live GitHub **Connect** runs the App-install flow, storing `{kind:"github_app", installation_id}` (no token) and mapping `installation_id ↔ workspace`. The App's single webhook URL (set once at App creation) lands at the ingress; the receiver verifies the App HMAC and routes by `installation_id` → workspace → matching fleet(s).
- **Dimension 5.1** — Connect → install → callback stores the handle (no token) + the `installation_id ↔ workspace` map → `test_github_connect_stores_handle`
- **Dimension 5.2** — App webhook → verify App HMAC → route by `installation_id` to the matching fleet's events stream → `test_ingress_routes_by_installation_id`
- **Dimension 5.3** — connected shows; uninstalled shows **Reconnect**; Slack/Zoho render "Planned" → `test_github_states_and_planned`

### §6 — Grant + approval placement
The standing **integration grant** (`core.integration_grants`) gates whether a fleet may use `github` at all — checked at lease-issue (no mintable handle without an approved grant) and re-checked at mint. The existing **approval gate** stays the per-write gate (poll/continuation), unchanged.
- **Dimension 6.1** — mint refused when the fleet has no approved `github` grant → `test_mint_requires_approved_grant`
- **Dimension 6.2** — lease attaches a mintable `github` handle only when the grant is approved → `test_lease_gates_mintable_on_grant`

### §7 — CLI connector ops + vault surfacing (fast-follow)
`agentsfleet connector` lists status (connected / needs-reconnect) as human + structured JSON; a disconnected connector returns a structured-JSON error with a non-zero exit (RULE JCL).
- **Dimension 7.1** — `connector list`/`status` reflects github state; `--json` shape is stable → `test_cli_connector_status`
- **Dimension 7.2** — acting through a disconnected connector → structured-JSON error + non-zero exit + reconnect suggestion → `test_cli_connector_disconnected_error`

### §8 — Docs sweep (absorb C1–C9)
Update the architecture docs the new model changes, owners before echoes (review companion): `user_flow.md` §8.2–8.5, `data_flow.md` §B/§C, `capabilities.md` §2–3 first; then `README.md` glossary, `high_level.md` §5.1, `scenarios/gh-pr-reviewer.md`, `runner_fleet.md` (one `agt_r` route), `roadmap.md`.
- **Dimension 8.1** — the manual-`gh-api-hooks` registration model is replaced by App-connect; no doc still asserts "user registers the webhook" for the App path → `test_docs_no_manual_gh_hook_for_app` (grep-based)
- **Dimension 8.2** — the "platform never holds the user's PAT" claim is reworded to distinguish the platform App key → `test_docs_app_key_vs_user_pat` (grep-based)

---

## Interfaces

```
CredentialBroker (daemon-side):
  mint(workspace_id, integration, scope?) -> ok{ token, expires_at }
       | reconnect_required | unknown_integration | mint_failed   (tagged union)
  driver registry:  kind -> Driver{ mint(handle, platform_secrets) }   # github_app | static | (oauth_refresh: future)

Runner mint route (existing agt_r plane):
  POST /v1/runners/me/credentials/mint  { lease_id, integration, scope? } -> { token, expires_at } | { error }
  # workspace derived from lease_id server-side; a caller-supplied workspace is ignored

GitHub App connect + App-level webhook:
  Connect -> App install -> callback { installation_id }
          -> vault fleet:github = { "kind":"github_app", "installation_id":"…" }   # NO token; map installation_id <-> workspace
  App single webhook URL -> POST /v1/ingress/github  (one platform App secret; payload.installation.id)
          -> verify App HMAC -> installation_id -> workspace -> matching fleet(s) -> XADD fleet:{id}:events

Tool placeholder (UNCHANGED for SKILL authors):
  ${secrets.github.token}  -> mintable kind -> broker mint ; static kind -> stored value
```

Mint result is a tagged union; `${secrets.…}` shape + kind ids are named constants shared verbatim with tests (RULE UFS). No existing endpoint or `ExecutionPolicy` field is repurposed; `secrets_map` gains mintable-handle entries beside static ones. The per-fleet `/v1/webhooks/{fleet_id}/{source}` route remains for non-App custom webhooks.

---

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling (system response + what the caller observes) |
|------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Unknown integration | mint for an integration never connected | typed `unknown_integration`; no token; CLI structured error |
| Installation revoked | App uninstalled between connect and use | typed `reconnect_required` (`UZ-GH-*`); UI "Reconnect", CLI error — never a silent 401 |
| Mint upstream failure | GitHub 5xx / network on the token exchange | typed `mint_failed` (retryable, ECL); tool call fails loudly, surfaced in Events |
| Forged workspace in mint request | a prompt-injected child supplies another workspace id | ignored; broker binds to the lease's workspace |
| App key exfil attempt | injected fleet reads env / secrets_map for the key | structurally absent from the child; nothing to read |
| Grant absent/revoked | fleet without an approved `github` grant requests a mint | mint refused; no token; lease never attaches the mintable handle |
| Webhook installation unmapped / bad sig | `installation_id` maps to no workspace, or unsigned/tampered payload | reject (`UZ-WH-*`/`UZ-WH-010`); no `XADD`; logged, no fleet woken |
| Stale cached token | token expired mid-run | broker re-mints transparently on next fetch |
| Partial placeholder substitution | a `${secrets.` survives substitution | dispatch aborted (existing leak guard) |
| token leak to logs | logging a mint result or handle | never logged or returned (VLT); only non-secret status/host appears |

---

## Invariants

1. **The App private key never enters the sandbox child** — enforced by the env deny-prefix (`AGENTSFLEET_*`), the broker living daemon-side, and `test_github_app_key_never_leaves_broker` asserting policy/`secrets_map`/frames carry no key or handle.
2. **A mint is scoped to the lease's workspace** — broker derives workspace from `lease_id`; a caller-supplied workspace is ignored (`test_mint_scoped_to_lease_workspace`).
3. **A mint requires an approved integration grant** — checked at lease-issue + mint; no grant ⇒ no mintable handle, no token (`test_mint_requires_approved_grant`).
4. **Adding a connector adds no branch to the mint hot path** — the registry is data; `test_driver_registry_is_data_driven`.
5. **Minted tokens are short-lived** — every driver returns `expires_at`; the broker never hands out an expired token (`test_broker_caches_until_expiry`).
6. **Mint result is a tagged union** — no fatal-silent path; compile-checked exhaustiveness.
7. **No new trust plane** — the mint route rides the existing `agt_r` plane; the App webhook rides the existing verifier; no new network surface from the sandbox (`test_child_requests_token_via_runner`).
8. **Secrets never logged or returned** — VLT; only host/status/expiry-bool appear in any frame or log.

| 5.2 | integration | `test_ingress_routes_by_installation_id` | App webhook → verified → XADD to the matching fleet only |
| 5.3 | unit | `test_github_states_and_planned` | connected/reconnect render; slack/zoho "Planned" + hint |

| 7.1 | e2e (cli) | `test_cli_connector_status` | `connector status --json` reflects live state |
| 7.2 | integration | `test_cli_connector_disconnected_error` | disconnected → structured-JSON error + non-zero exit |
| 8.1 | unit (doc grep) | `test_docs_no_manual_gh_hook_for_app` | no arch doc asserts user-`gh api …/hooks` for the App path |
| 8.2 | unit (doc grep) | `test_docs_app_key_vs_user_pat` | the "never holds the user's PAT" claim distinguishes the App key |

**Regression:** static custom-secret resolution, model routing, the inbound webhook HMAC path, and the sandbox env allowlist unchanged except assertions tracking intentional additions. **Idempotency/replay:** re-minting yields a fresh valid token; a cached token is reused until near expiry; repeated connect is idempotent on `installation_id`; the App ingress dedupes on the delivery id. **Integration coverage:** broker→github_app→fake-GitHub mint, child→runner→broker round-trip, the revoked-installation reconnect path, and ingress installation_id routing are injected deterministically.

## Dead Code Sweep

**1. Orphaned files** — none deleted; this is additive. New files per Files Changed.

**2. Orphaned references** — grep after the changes; non-zero = stale.

| Removed/renamed symbol | Grep | Expected |
|------------------------|------|----------|
| ad-hoc per-call vault reads bypassing the broker | `grep -rn "vault.loadJson" src/agentsfleetd/runner --include='*.zig' \| head` | 0 (mintable creds route through the broker) |
| `"github_app"` literal | `grep -rn '"github_app"' src/ cli/ ui/ \| grep -v const \| head` | only the named-constant defs + imports (RULE UFS) |

## Discovery (consult log)

> **Empty at creation.** Populate as work surfaces consults, skill outcomes, and Indy-acked deferrals.

- **Origin (Indy + Orly/CTO, Jun 25–26 2026):** reborn from DEFERRED M99_001 per its "re-spec under the agent-identity-proxy framing" note. Indy's caveat is the reason to exist — *"the agentsfleetd-credentials-proxy: this will become too static that expanding and supporting more connectors will be a pain."* Resolution: config-driven driver registry (RULE CFG), connector = descriptor.
- **Refinements this session:** (1) App-level webhook ingress routed by `installation_id` — one App webhook URL set once by the platform, no per-repo registration (M99 §5 under-specified). (2) grant/approval placement made explicit — grant at lease+mint, approval gate per-write unchanged. (3) Surface order: Indy chose **UI-first**.
- **Doc-shape review:** `docs/v2/reviews/m102-doc-shape-review.md` (C1–C9 + invariants-that-hold); §8 absorbs it.
- **Open to confirm at PLAN:** App registration ownership + admin-vault key storage; child→runner mint request framing; whether the App webhook reuses `/v1/webhooks/{fleet_id}` internally or a new `/v1/ingress/github` path.
- **Deferrals:** `oauth_refresh` driver, per-fleet cryptographic identity / Agent Auth wire format, Stripe Agentic Commerce Protocol, exact-action approval-hash binding — Out of Scope, not dropped Dimensions; custom secrets bridge the non-GitHub connectors until then.

## Skill-Driven Review Chain (mandatory)

| When | Skill | What it does | Required output |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| After implementation, before CHORE(close) | `/write-unit-test` | Audits diff coverage vs the Test Specification (≥50% negative; every Failure Mode covered) | Clean; iteration count in Discovery |
| After tests pass, before CHORE(close) | `/review` | Adversarial diff review vs this spec, `docs/AUTH.md`, `dispatch/write_zig.md`, `dispatch/write_ts_adhere_bun.md`, Failure Modes, Invariants (esp. key-never-in-child + workspace-scope + grant-gate) | Clean or every finding dispositioned |
| After `gh pr create` | `/review-pr` | Review-comments the open PR | Comments addressed before human review |

## Out of Scope

- The `oauth_refresh` driver + Slack/Zoho/Jira/Linear connectors — follow-up; custom secrets bridge them (the abstraction is built here so they are descriptors).
- Per-fleet cryptographic identity / Agent Auth Protocol wire-format alignment — the v3 capability-token layer; the App installation is the identity for now.
- Stripe Agentic Commerce Protocol — a future financial-mutation capability, gated by the same approval machinery.
- Exact-action approval-hash binding ("approve this comment on this line") — reuse the coarse integration grant now; the named Approach-B follow-up.
- A standalone credentials microservice; per-credential fleet-usage analytics; rotation automation beyond mint-on-demand.
- Replacing static custom secrets — they remain a first-class `static` kind.
