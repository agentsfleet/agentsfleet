# M84_007: Runner credential file-descriptor inheritance proof

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M84
**Workstream:** 007
**Date:** Jun 06, 2026
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Priority:** P1 — security boundary, **launch-targeted** (not deferred). Proof-only: it pins an already-correct property (no daemon file descriptor crosses `exec` into the sandboxed child) with regression tests, so a future change cannot silently re-open a credential-inheritance escape. Ships for launch precisely because it adds no new subsystem and no new behaviour — only assertions over the existing `forkExec`/spawn path.
**Categories:** API
**Batch:** B1 — standalone; the proof rides the existing `test-integration-runner` lane.
**Branch:** feat/m84-credential-fd-proof
**Depends on:** **M84_003 (sandbox env/fd hardening)** — its code is in `main` (`child_process.forkExec`, the env-allowlist filter, and the `test-integration-runner` lane in `build_runner.zig` / `make/test-integration.mk` this proof extends). No code dependency on the deferred specs.
**Provenance:** agent-generated — this proof began as M84_006 §2, was briefly proposed as M84_004 §5, then split into its own launch-safe spec (Jun 06, 2026) because the egress proxy (M84_004 §1–§4) and cap-drop/containment (M84_006) stay **deferred behind the untrusted-runner GA trigger**, whereas this proof is launch-safe and ships now. The credential-**out** channel (egress) is M84_004; the credential-**in**-via-fd channel is this spec — the daemon's own credential never reaching the child in the first place.

> **Provenance is load-bearing.** Every claim was code-grounded against `main` in the worktree: `forkExec` calls `std.process.spawn` with `.stdin=.pipe / .stdout=.pipe / .stderr=.inherit / .pgid=0` and **no** `progress_node` (so it defaults to `std.Progress.Node.none` — `std/process.zig` SpawnOptions); `LoopbackClient` (`control_plane_client.zig`) holds only `base_url` + `io`, opening a `std.http.Client` per call and freeing it before return; `sandbox_integration_test.zig` already forks real children to prove the env-allowlist filter. Re-confirm at PLAN.

**Canonical architecture:** [`docs/architecture/runner_fleet.md`](../../architecture/runner_fleet.md) §Sandbox tiers. This spec verifies the file-descriptor surface of the existing process boundary; it changes no mechanism.

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. `src/runner/sandbox_integration_test.zig` — the Linux-only real-process proof file (already wired to `test-integration` in `build_runner.zig`). The `"a planted daemon token never reaches a real spawned child's environment"` test + the `spawnIo` / `readToEnd` helpers are the exact pattern to mirror for the marker-fd and stray-fd proofs.
2. `src/runner/child_process.zig` — `forkExec` → `std.process.spawn`. Confirms the spawn options that cross into the child (only the stdio pipes; no `progress_node`).
3. `src/runner/daemon/control_plane_client.zig` — `LoopbackClient`; confirms the `zrn_`-bearing control-plane socket is per-call (`std.http.Client.fetch`) and the struct holds no persistent fd field.
4. `build_runner.zig` — the `runner_integration_tests` artifact (root `sandbox_integration_test.zig`, step `test-integration`); confirms new integration tests in that file need **no** build wiring.
5. `dispatch/write_zig.md` — all `*.zig` edits.

## PR Intent & comprehension handshake

- **PR title (eventual):** `test(m84_007): prove no daemon credential fd crosses exec into the sandboxed child`
- **Intent (one sentence):** Pin, with regression tests, that the sandboxed child inherits **only** wired stdio (fd 0/1/2) — no daemon-held file descriptor (the `zrn_` control-plane socket, cgroup/datastore handles) crosses `exec` — so a prompt-injected agent has no inherited capability to replay calls as the runner or reach the data plane.
- **Handshake (agent fills at PLAN, before EXECUTE):** restate intent; list `ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:`. Confirm the marker-fd probe + `/proc/self/fd` enumeration run on the Linux CI lane and that the unit structural assertion compiles on macOS.

---

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`**:
  - **RULE NDC** — proof-only: the inherited-fd vector is already closed (Zig `O_CLOEXEC` defaults; only fd 0/1/2 wired; control-plane client per-call-freed; cgroup fds `defer`-closed). This spec adds **assertions + regression tests, never a production guard** — no dead/no-op code.
  - **RULE NLR** — any file touched (`sandbox_integration_test.zig`, `control_plane_client.zig`) is left at or above its current cleanliness; no opportunistic refactor.
  - **RULE UFS** — the marker-fd probe value and any literal flags/markers are single-sourced named constants in the test, reused across asserts (mirror the existing `PLANTED_TOKEN`).
  - **RULE TST-NAM** — test block names carry no `M84_007` / `§` / dimension IDs (descriptive prose only).
  - **RULE NLG** — pre-2.0: no "legacy" framing.
- **`dispatch/write_zig.md`** — tagged-union results, `errdefer`, cross-compile both linux targets (the test graph).

## Applicable Gates

| Gate | Fires? | Satisfaction strategy |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| ZIG GATE | **yes** — `*.zig` edits | Read `dispatch/write_zig.md`; cross-compile the runner TEST graph for both linux targets. |
| LENGTH (≤350/≤50/≤70) | **maybe** — `sandbox_integration_test.zig` grows | Keep each test ≤50 lines; reuse `spawnIo`/`readToEnd`; if the file nears 350, split the fd proofs into a sibling integration file added to the `test-integration` artifact. |
| UFS | **maybe** — marker/probe literals | Named constants in the test (mirror `PLANTED_TOKEN`). |
| PUB | **no** | No new public surface; tests reuse the already-`pub` `buildChildEnviron`/spawn path. |
| LIFECYCLE | **no** | Each test opens its own marker fd and `defer`-closes it; adds no daemon-owned resource. |
| LOGGING | **no** | No new log emit. |

## Overview

**Goal (testable):** A real child spawned through the same `std.process.spawn` path `forkExec` uses sees exactly fds `0/1/2` in `/proc/self/fd`; a marker fd opened by the parent daemon returns `EBADF` from `fcntl(N, F_GETFD)` in the child; and `LoopbackClient` provably holds no persistent file-descriptor field — each proven by a test that fails the build if the property regresses.

**Problem:** The classic sandbox escape is inheriting an open capability — a socket, database handle, or control pipe — across `exec`. In this runner the daemon holds the `zrn_` runner token on a `std.http.Client` socket (`control_plane_client.zig`), plus cgroup and (in other build configs) datastore handles. An inherited control-plane socket would let a prompt-injected agent replay calls to `zombied` **as the runner** (cross-tenant blast radius — tenant scoping is not yet enforced at the lease layer); an inherited datastore handle would be direct data-plane access bypassing the API. The vector is **already closed** (Zig `O_CLOEXEC` defaults; only fd 0/1/2 cross via `dup2`; the control-plane client is per-call-`deinit`'d; cgroup fds are `defer`-closed; the supervisor reaps before the next fork) — but it is **unproven**, so a future open site that forgets `CLOEXEC`, or a pooled/persistent control-plane client, could silently re-open it.

**Solution summary:** Add real-process regression tests on the existing `test-integration-runner` lane that fork a child the way `forkExec` does and assert the child inherits only wired stdio, plus a structural unit assertion that the control-plane client carries no persistent socket. No mechanism change — proof only.

---

## Prior-Art / Reference Implementations

- **`sandbox_integration_test.zig`** — the existing `"planted daemon token never reaches a real spawned child"` test forks an actual child via `std.process.spawn` and inspects its observable state; the fd proofs mirror it exactly (same `spawnIo`/`readToEnd` helpers, same `SkipZigTest`-on-non-Linux gate).
- **CLOEXEC-by-default fd-inheritance audit** — the standard `posix_spawn`/`fork`+`exec` hardening check (enumerate the child's `/proc/self/fd`, assert no unexpected inherited fd); mirrors how sandboxes verify no capability leaks across `exec`.

---

## Files Changed (blast radius)

| File | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `src/runner/sandbox_integration_test.zig` | EDIT | Add the Linux-only marker-fd-not-inherited + no-stray-fd real-process proofs (mirror the planted-token test). |
| `src/runner/daemon/control_plane_client.zig` | EDIT | Add the structural unit test (+ `comptime` assertion) that `LoopbackClient` holds no persistent fd-bearing field; document the per-call-freed socket invariant. |

> No `build_runner.zig` or `make/test-integration.mk` change — `sandbox_integration_test.zig` is already the `test-integration` artifact root; the unit test rides the normal runner test graph.

## Decomposition & alternatives (patch vs refactor)

- **Chosen shape:** additive proof; **patch**, behaviour-preserving (the legitimate lease is unchanged). One Section, four Dimensions sharing the existing lanes.
- **Alternatives considered:** (a) **Leave it in M84_006/M84_004** — rejected: both are deferred behind untrusted-runner GA, and this proof is launch-safe and should not be gated behind work it does not need. (b) **Fold into M84_003** — rejected: M84_003 is already merged (#370) and closing; reopening it to append a section is messier than a focused standalone spec. (c) **A standalone marker-fd test only** — rejected: the `/proc/self/fd` enumeration is the catch-all that also covers a future progress-fd-3 regression, so both belong.

---

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — No daemon credential file descriptor crosses `exec`

A child spawned the way `forkExec` spawns inherits only the deliberately-wired stdio. Prove it three ways (real-process marker, real-process enumeration, structural client assertion) and record the daemon open-site audit.

- **Dimension 1.1** — a marker fd opened by the parent (default flags) is not accessible in the spawned child → Test `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child` (child `fcntl(N, F_GETFD)` → `EBADF`)
- **Dimension 1.2** — the child sees no unexpected open fd ≥ 3 beyond wired stdio → Test `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` (child `/proc/self/fd` lists only `0/1/2`; this subsumes any `progress_node` fd-3 path, which `forkExec` leaves at `.none`)
- **Dimension 1.3** — the control-plane client holds no persistent socket: `LoopbackClient` has only `base_url` + `io`; every `std.http.Client` is per-call and freed before any fork → Test `test_control_plane_client_holds_no_persistent_fd` (structural / `comptime`)
- **Dimension 1.4** — Discovery enumerates every daemon open site (control-plane socket, cgroup fds, lease pipes) and records each as `CLOEXEC`-by-default or `defer`-closed-before-fork → assertion table in Discovery

---

## Interfaces

> **Illustrative — exact probe mechanism verified at PLAN.** Contract, not implementation. This spec adds **no production interface**; it asserts existing behaviour.

```
# Proof contract (observed, not changed):
#   spawn(child) via the forkExec path  =>  child /proc/self/fd == { 0, 1, 2 }
#   parent opens marker fd N (default flags)  =>  child fcntl(N, F_GETFD) == EBADF
#   LoopbackClient fields ⊆ { base_url, io }  (no socket/fd-bearing field; sockets are per-call + freed)
#   forkExec spawn options: progress_node == std.Progress.Node.none  (no fd 3)
```

Contract: the legitimate sandboxed lease is observably unchanged; only the file-descriptor surface is now pinned by tests.

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling (system response + what the caller observes) |
|------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| A daemon open site forgets `CLOEXEC` | future code adds a non-`CLOEXEC` open before fork | `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child` + `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` fail the build before merge. |
| A pooled / persistent control-plane client is introduced | a refactor adds a long-lived socket field to `LoopbackClient` | `test_control_plane_client_holds_no_persistent_fd` fails — the structural invariant breaks at compile/test time. |
| `std` default flips to set a progress fd | toolchain bump re-introduces an fd-3 progress sink | `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` catches the unexpected fd 3. |
| Test runs on macOS | no `/proc`, no real netns | Linux-gated (`SkipZigTest`); macOS proof = cross-compile the runner TEST graph for both linux targets. |

---

## Invariants

1. **Only wired stdio crosses `exec`** — a child spawned via the `forkExec` path lists exactly fds `0/1/2`; no daemon fd ≥ 3 is inherited. Enforced by `test_no_stray_fds_in_child`.
2. **Daemon-opened fds are `CLOEXEC`** — a parent marker fd is `EBADF` in the child. Enforced by `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child`.
3. **The control-plane client is fd-stateless** — `LoopbackClient` holds no persistent socket/fd field; every credential-bearing socket is per-call and freed before any fork, so none is live at spawn. Enforced by `test_control_plane_client_holds_no_persistent_fd`. **Proof, not patch.**

---

## Test Specification (tiered)

> **Lane:** the Linux-only proofs run on the **`test-integration-runner`** lane (`zig build --build-file build_runner.zig test-integration`, the `make test-integration-runner` target) — they fork real children and read `/proc/self/fd`, a Linux runtime. `builtin.os.tag == .linux`-gated (`SkipZigTest` on macOS). macOS dev-loop proof = cross-compile the runner TEST graph for both linux targets. The structural unit test runs everywhere (normal runner test graph).

| Dimension | Tier | Test | Asserts (concrete inputs → expected output) |
|-----------|------|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1.1 | integration-runner | `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child` | parent opens marker fd N (default flags); child `fcntl(N, F_GETFD)` → `EBADF` |
| 1.2 | integration-runner | `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` | child enumerates `/proc/self/fd` → only `0`, `1`, `2` present (no fd ≥ 3) |
| 1.3 | unit | `test_control_plane_client_holds_no_persistent_fd` | `LoopbackClient` fields ⊆ `{ base_url, io }`; no socket/fd-bearing field (structural / `comptime`) |
| 1.4 | (assertion) | Discovery table | each daemon open site recorded `CLOEXEC`-by-default or `defer`-closed-before-fork |

- **Regression:** the existing runner suite (`make test-unit-zigrunner`) + the M84_003 env-filter integration proofs stay green; the legitimate sandboxed lease still spawns and runs.
- **Idempotency/replay:** N/A.

## Discovery (consult log)

- **Origin (Jun 06, 2026):** this proof was M84_006 §2, briefly proposed as M84_004 §5, then split into this launch-safe spec. Indy decision (verbatim, Jun 06, 2026): _"do"_ — context: the recommendation to defer the egress proxy (M84_004 §1–§4) and cap-drop/containment (M84_006) behind untrusted-runner GA, while landing the proof-only credential-fd belt now. Both deferred specs keep their `Out of Scope` cross-reference pointing here.
- **Code-grounded facts (worktree `main`):** `forkExec` → `std.process.spawn` with `.stdin/.stdout=.pipe`, `.stderr=.inherit`, `.pgid=0`, no `progress_node` (defaults `.none`); `LoopbackClient` fields are only `base_url` + `io`, one `std.http.Client` per verb, response freed before return; `sandbox_integration_test.zig` already forks real children (`spawnIo`, `readToEnd`, `SkipZigTest` on non-Linux) and is the `test-integration` artifact root, so the new integration tests need no build wiring.
- **Daemon open-site audit (Dimension 1.4 — fill at EXECUTE):** { control-plane `std.http.Client` socket → per-call, freed before return ; cgroup scope fds → `defer`-closed ; lease stdio pipes → `dup2` to 0/1, parent ends `CLOEXEC` ; … }
- **PLAN decisions to bank:** confirm the marker-fd `fcntl` probe + `/proc/self/fd` read run under the `__execute`-stub child harness on the Linux CI lane; confirm the structural client assertion compiles on macOS.
- **Deferrals** — none. Any "deferred to follow-up" needs an Indy-acked verbatim quote here.
- **Skill chain outcomes** — {`/write-unit-test`, `/review`, `/review-pr` results.}

## Skill-Driven Review Chain (mandatory)

## Out of Scope

- **M84_004 egress allowlist** (own-netns + DNS-pinning proxy) — the credential-**out** channel; deferred behind untrusted-runner GA. This spec is the credential-**in**-via-fd channel.
- **M84_006 cap-drop + containment verification** — deferred behind untrusted-runner GA.
- **The env-allowlist filter** — already shipped + tested in M84_003 (`buildChildEnviron`); this spec proves the *fd* surface, not the *env* surface.
- **Enforcing tenant scoping at the lease layer** — the reason an inherited control-plane socket would be cross-tenant; that is a separate fleet-scope workstream, named here as the amplifying factor, not fixed.
