# M63_006: zombiectl runCommand migration — every handler routes through the per-command boundary

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M63
**Workstream:** 006
**Date:** May 08, 2026
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Priority:** P2 — `runCommand` shipped in M63_004 but no handler imports it; the catch logic still lives inline in `cli.js`. The wrapper is dead code until commands migrate.
**Categories:** CLI, OBS
**Batch:** B1 — independent of any other in-flight workstream. No external dependencies.
**Branch:** feat/m63-006-runcommand-migration
**Depends on:** M63_004_P1_CLI_OBS_RESILIENCE — `runCommand`, `apiRequestWithRetry`, `trackHttpRequest/Retry` already exist; this spec consumes them.

**Canonical architecture:** `zombiectl` is the customer/operator entry point. M63_004 introduced the resilience layer; M63_006 finishes the rollout so every command shares one error-handling, telemetry, and exit-code boundary. Bundled in this workstream is a privacy-posture correction: today's default sends every CLI invocation to PostHog (the bundled project key makes `enabled = (key.length > 0)` resolve to true unless the user explicitly opts out via `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED=0`). M63_002 attempted to fix this with a consent prompt and was deferred (`docs/v2/done/M63_002_P1_CLI_TELEMETRY_CONSENT.md`). M63_006 takes the simpler path: flip the default to off and rename the flag.

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. `zombiectl/src/lib/run-command.js` — the wrapper to migrate onto. Note the signature: `runCommand({ name, handler, retry, instrument, errorMap, ctx, deps })` and the returned exit code (0/1). Every command in this spec ends up wrapping its body through this entry point.
2. `zombiectl/src/cli.js:280-318` — the inline top-level catch that distinguishes `ApiError` / `TypeError("fetch failed")` / unknown. Once every command runs through `runCommand`, this catch becomes a thin safety net (or goes away). The spec keeps the safety net; what changes is that handlers no longer rely on it for normal error formatting.
3. `zombiectl/src/program/command-registry.js` — where commands are wired into the dispatcher. The registry is the natural choke point for the migration: each registered command is reshaped to delegate through `runCommand`.
4. `zombiectl/src/commands/*.js` — 14 handler files, every one currently shaped as `export async function commandX(ctx, args, workspaces, deps)`. The migration preserves the external signature and inserts `runCommand` as the body's outermost call.
5. `zombiectl/src/program/http-client.js:7-50` — `request()` already routes through `apiRequestWithRetry`. Confirms handlers do not need code changes for retry; they only inherit `errorMap`-driven user messages.
6. `zombiectl/src/lib/analytics.js:65-90` — `trackCliEvent`, `trackHttpRequest`, `trackHttpRetry`. The `cli_command_started/finished/error` triplet currently fires from `cli.js`; once every command is migrated, it fires from inside `runCommand` instead, carrying per-command props.
7. `docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` §error-shape — canonical UZ-* error envelope. The `errorMap` per command keys off these codes.
8. `docs/v2/done/M63_004_P1_CLI_OBS_RESILIENCE.md` §3 — the "Out of Scope" carve-out that this spec discharges. Review the boundaries M63_004 set so we don't relitigate them.

If any handler currently does its own `try { … } catch (err) { … }` to format an `ApiError`, the migration removes that catch and pushes the per-code message into the `errorMap`. Handlers retain `try` blocks ONLY when they have legitimate per-step recovery logic (e.g., poll loops with their own backoff).

---

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`** — universal. Rules in scope:
  - **RULE NSQ** (no silent quiet) — every command emits the `cli_command_started/finished/error` triplet via `runCommand`; no handler may swallow an error without surfacing through the wrapper.
  - **RULE EMS** (exception messages stable) — `errorMap` entries become the user-facing surface for known UZ-* codes; once shipped they are stable strings.
  - **RULE TST-NAM** — no milestone IDs in test names or fixture names.
  - **RULE NDC** / **RULE NLR** — once migration completes, the inline catch in `cli.js` becomes dead code (only the safety net remains); delete the duplicated formatting; do not retain a "legacy" branch.
  - **RULE NLG** (no legacy framing pre-v2.0.0) — `cat VERSION` is < 2.0.0; the spec must not introduce `legacy_*` names, `V2` twins, or compat shims for the unmigrated handlers. The single PR migrates them all.
- **`docs/BUN_RULES.md`** — TS/JS file shape, const/import discipline, file-as-module pattern. Every modified handler stays under the 350-line file gate.
- **`docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`** §error-shape — only consulted to enumerate the UZ-* codes that the `errorMap` audit knows about. This spec does not add or modify any HTTP route.

Standard set is the floor. No Zig, schema, or auth-flow concerns.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (read this BEFORE drafting the spec)

(Template guidance — already absorbed during drafting.)

---

## Overview

**Goal (testable):** (a) Telemetry is **off by default** — `zombiectl` invoked with no env vars produces zero PostHog events, and the only on-switch is `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=0` (the renamed env var; `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED` is removed in this commit per RULE NLG); (b) every command registered in `zombiectl/src/program/command-registry.js` dispatches through `runCommand({ name, errorMap, handler })`; the inline catch in `cli.js` collapses to a thin safety net; a new audit script `scripts/audit-cli-runcommand.sh` fails CI when any registered command bypasses the wrapper or omits an `errorMap` entry for the UZ-* codes its endpoints can return.

**Problem (operator-visible):** Today, error messages drift across commands — `commandSteer` formats an `ApiError` one way, `commandBillingShow` another, and a third command silently exits with the bare server message because no one wrote a per-code translation. Per-command analytics props (`exit_code`, `error_code`, command-specific `target` IDs) are missing because the catch lives in `cli.js` where the command name is the only handle. New commands added since M63_004 reproduce the old shape because there is no compiler/audit signal that `runCommand` exists.

**Solution summary:** Migrate every file in `zombiectl/src/commands/*.js` (14 files) so each registered handler is exposed as `{ name, errorMap, handler }`; the registry wraps it with `runCommand` at dispatch. The inline `cli.js` catch is reduced to a last-resort `process.on("uncaughtException")` net. A new `scripts/audit-cli-runcommand.sh` enumerates registered commands, asserts each one declares an `errorMap`, and asserts the map covers every UZ-* code the command's reachable endpoints can return (cross-checked against `zombiectl/src/lib/api-paths.js` and the OpenAPI document). The audit runs in `make lint`.

## Files Changed (blast radius)

| File | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `zombiectl/src/lib/analytics.js` | EDIT | §0. Rename env var `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED` → `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` with inverted semantics. Flip default: telemetry off when neither the env var nor an explicit opt-in is present. `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_KEY` / `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_HOST` (transport overrides) stay unchanged. |
| `zombiectl/test/analytics.unit.test.js` | EDIT | §0. Update existing assertions from `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED` to `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`; add cases for the new default-off behavior and `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=0` opt-in. |
| `zombiectl/test/cli-analytics.unit.test.js` | EDIT | §0. Same env-var rename in the higher-level smoke test. |
| `zombiectl/src/program/command-registry.js` | EDIT | Dispatch every registered command through `runCommand`. Inject `errorMap` and `name` per registration. Single choke point for the migration. |
| `zombiectl/src/commands/agent.js` | EDIT | Convert exported `commandAgent` to `{ name, errorMap, handler }` shape; remove inline `try/catch` for `ApiError` formatting. |
| `zombiectl/src/commands/agent_external.js` | EDIT | Same pattern; three sub-commands (add/list/delete) each get an `errorMap`. |
| `zombiectl/src/commands/billing.js` | EDIT | Same pattern; `commandBilling` + `commandBillingShow`. |
| `zombiectl/src/commands/core-ops.js` | EDIT | Same pattern. |
| `zombiectl/src/commands/core.js` | EDIT | Same pattern; auth-critical (login/logout/hydration) — keep current message strings verbatim in the `errorMap` so user-visible behavior is byte-identical. |

| `zombiectl/src/commands/tenant_provider.js` | EDIT | Same pattern; show/add/delete. |

| `zombiectl/src/lib/run-command.js` | EDIT (light) | If the audit reveals shape mismatches (e.g., handlers needing `args` plus `ctx`), tighten the wrapper signature and update the docstring. No new public surface. |
| `scripts/audit-cli-runcommand.sh` | CREATE | New audit. Enumerates registered commands; fails if any bypasses `runCommand` or omits an `errorMap` entry for reachable UZ-* codes. Wired into `make lint`. |
| `Makefile` | EDIT | Wire `audit-cli-runcommand` into the `lint` target alongside the existing CLI audits. |
| `zombiectl/test/run-command.unit.test.js` | EDIT | Extend with cases asserting (a) the wrapper invokes the handler with the existing `(ctx, args, workspaces, deps)` shape preserved, (b) `errorMap` rewrites `ApiError.code → user-facing code+message`, (c) `cli_command_started/finished/error` events carry the per-command name verbatim. |
| `zombiectl/test/commands/registry.unit.test.js` | CREATE | New unit suite asserting every registered command exports a `name` + `errorMap` + `handler` triple and the dispatch path returns the wrapper's exit code. |
| `zombiectl/test/commands/error-map.fixture.js` | CREATE | Shared fixture: list of `{ command, expectedCodes }` derived from `api-paths.js` + OpenAPI. The audit script and the unit suite both read it. |
| `~/Projects/docs/changelog.mdx` | EDIT (at CHORE(close)) | New `<Update>` describing the migration in user-visible terms — "every CLI command now reports a stable error code and surfaces server messages consistently". |

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §0 — Telemetry default off + flag rename (lands first on the branch)

What §0 delivers: `zombiectl` no longer emits PostHog events on a fresh install. The single env-var control surface is `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`; absent or `=1` keeps telemetry off; `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=0` opts in and wakes the existing transport. The legacy `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED` is removed in the same commit (RULE NLG — pre-v2.0.0, no compat shim, single-PR cutover).

`resolveConfig` becomes:

- Read `env.DISABLE_TELEMETRY`. Treat `1`/`true`/`on`/`yes` (or absent) as disabled. Treat `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` as opt-in.
- When disabled, return `{ enabled: false }` — `createCliAnalytics` exits without importing `posthog-node` and returns `null`, so the rest of the CLI sees a null client and the existing `trackCliEvent` early-returns are no-ops.
- When opt-in, the rest of the existing transport stays — `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_KEY` and `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_HOST` overrides keep their meaning; the bundled default key is still the fallback so the Captain's project receives events from operators who explicitly opt in.

**Implementation default:** keep the bundled default key. Removing it is its own decision and is out of scope here. With telemetry off by default, the bundled key only matters when an operator explicitly sets `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=0`.

§0 lands as the first commit on `feat/m63-006-runcommand-migration` so subsequent commits in §1-§5 can rely on the new env-var name in tests and audits without juggling two surfaces.

### §1 — Registry-driven dispatch

The migration's single load-bearing change. `zombiectl/src/program/command-registry.js` is the only file that calls handlers; once it wraps every dispatch with `runCommand`, every command is migrated regardless of its file.

What §1 delivers: the registry imports `runCommand`, exposes a single `dispatch(name, ctx, args, …)` entry point, and every entry in the registry's table carries `{ name, errorMap, handler }`. Handlers themselves don't change shape yet.

**Implementation default:** the dispatcher reads `errorMap` from the registry table — handlers do NOT receive it. This keeps handlers unaware of the wrapper and lets the audit script enforce one canonical declaration site.

### §2 — Per-command `errorMap` declarations

Each command declares the UZ-* codes its reachable endpoints can return and the user-facing message+code for each. The map lives next to the handler in the same file.

What §2 delivers: every file under `zombiectl/src/commands/` exports an `errorMap` object alongside the handler. Codes the command does not call are absent (zero-cost). Codes the command MUST handle (per the audit, derived from `api-paths.js` + OpenAPI) are present.

**Implementation default:** when a code maps to the same human message in multiple commands, lift it into a shared `zombiectl/src/lib/error-map-presets.js` and re-export. The audit treats presets identically to inline maps.

### §3 — Inline-catch teardown in `cli.js`

What §3 delivers: `cli.js`'s top-level catch is reduced to a `process.on("uncaughtException")`-style safety net that emits `cli_error{ code: "UNEXPECTED" }` and exits 1. The `ApiError` and `fetch failed` branches are deleted because every code path that produced them now flows through `runCommand`.

**Implementation default:** keep the safety net even though §1+§2 should cover every dispatch path — defense in depth for any code that runs before the registry is constructed (e.g., flag parser fatal). The safety net does NOT format `ApiError` (impossible to reach there); it only handles raw thrown errors.

### §4 — `audit-cli-runcommand.sh` + Makefile wiring

What §4 delivers: a shell script that

- parses `command-registry.js` to enumerate registered names,
- asserts every entry uses `runCommand` (no direct handler call),
- asserts every entry has an `errorMap`,
- cross-references each command against the endpoint paths it touches (via `api-paths.js`) and the OpenAPI document, and asserts the `errorMap` covers every UZ-* code those endpoints can return.

The script fails fast with a non-zero exit and a per-violation report. It is added to `make lint`.

**Implementation default:** the cross-reference is built from a static map, not by tracing imports — handlers may construct paths dynamically. The static map lives in `error-map.fixture.js` and is generated from `api-paths.js`. Manual additions are allowed (e.g., a command that hits more than one endpoint) but every entry must list its endpoints explicitly.

### §5 — Test coverage and changelog

What §5 delivers: extended `run-command.unit.test.js`, a new `registry.unit.test.js`, and a `<Update>` block in `~/Projects/docs/changelog.mdx` describing the user-visible behavior (consistent error codes across every CLI command, stable server-message surfacing). Tests live next to the migration so they ship in the same commit.

---

## Interfaces

The registry table entries become:

```
{
  name: "zombie steer",
  errorMap: {
    "UZ-WS-404":      { code: "WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND", message: "workspace not found — check `zombie workspace list`" },
    "UZ-ZB-404":      { code: "ZOMBIE_NOT_FOUND",     message: "zombie not found in this workspace" },
    "UZ-AUTH-401":    { code: "EXPIRED_SESSION",       message: "session expired — run `zombie login`" }
  },
  endpoints: ["POST /v2/workspaces/:wsid/zombies/:zid/steer"],
  handler: commandSteer
}
```

`runCommand` receives `{ name, errorMap, handler, ctx, deps, retry, instrument }` (already implemented). Handler signature is unchanged (`(ctx, args, workspaces, deps)`); the registry adapts the call.

`scripts/audit-cli-runcommand.sh` exit codes:

- `0` — every registered command uses `runCommand` and declares `errorMap` covering reachable UZ-* codes.
- `1` — at least one command bypasses `runCommand`, omits `errorMap`, or has gaps relative to its declared endpoints. Output lists the offending command + missing codes.

No HTTP routes, schema, or auth flow changes.

---

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling |
|------|-------|----------|
| Handler throws `ApiError` for an unmapped UZ-* code | Endpoint added a new code; `errorMap` not updated | `runCommand` falls through to the raw `code`/`message` from the server (today's behavior). Audit flags it on next `make lint`. |
| Audit false positive: command's reachable codes change without `api-paths.js` update | Static map drift | Audit fails fast; PR is blocked until either `errorMap` or the `endpoints` declaration is corrected. |
| Handler still does its own `try/catch` for legitimate per-step recovery | Long poll loops, retry-with-jitter inside login | Allowed. Audit detects only top-level direct dispatch outside `runCommand`. Per-step `try/catch` inside the handler body is fine. |
| Two commands map the same UZ-* code to different user messages | Inconsistent operator surface | Allowed at the JS level, surfaced by a `make lint` warning (not error). Encourages migration into `error-map-presets.js`. |
| `runCommand` swallows an error class today's `cli.js` catch surfaced | Migration regression | Tests in `run-command.unit.test.js` cover every error class; `make test` blocks the migration. |
| New command file added without registry entry | Dead code | Registry is the source of truth; dead command files are caught by RULE ORP at next CHORE(close). |

---

## Invariants

1. Every entry in `command-registry.js` exports `{ name, errorMap, handler }`. — Enforced by `scripts/audit-cli-runcommand.sh` in `make lint`.
2. Every reachable UZ-* code (per the `endpoints` declaration) is keyed in the corresponding `errorMap`. — Enforced by the same audit.
3. No handler imports `ApiError` for the purpose of formatting — handlers may still `instanceof`-check for control flow, but message-formatting lives only in `errorMap` entries or `runCommand`. — Enforced by a grep pattern in the audit (`new ApiError\\(` outside `lib/`, `printApiError\\(` outside `lib/`).
4. `cli.js` no longer contains an `ApiError`-formatting branch in its top-level catch. — Enforced by the audit (`grep -n 'ApiError' zombiectl/src/cli.js` returns zero matches outside imports).
5. `cli_command_started` and `cli_command_finished` (or `cli_error`) emit exactly once per dispatch. — Enforced by the existing `run-command.unit.test.js` plus the new registry test.
6. `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` is the only env var that toggles event emission. — Enforced by `grep -rn 'ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED' zombiectl/` returning zero matches after §0 lands; the audit covers it.

## Test Specification

| Test | Asserts |
|------|---------|
| `test_registry_every_command_uses_runCommand` | Iterates every registry entry; asserts dispatch uses `runCommand` (mocked) and the handler is reached only through it. |
| `test_registry_every_command_declares_errorMap` | Asserts every entry has a non-null `errorMap` object. |
| `test_errorMap_covers_reachable_codes` | Reads `error-map.fixture.js`; for each `{ command, expectedCodes }`, asserts every expected code is keyed in the command's `errorMap`. |
| `test_runCommand_translates_ApiError_via_errorMap` | Mock handler throws `ApiError` with code `UZ-WS-404`; assert `runCommand` returns 1 AND the `cli_error` event carries `error_code = "WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND"` AND `writeError` receives the mapped message. |
| `test_runCommand_unmapped_code_falls_through` | Mock handler throws `ApiError` with code `UZ-XX-999` (not in `errorMap`); assert `runCommand` returns 1 AND emits `cli_error` with `error_code = "UZ-XX-999"` AND surfaces the server message verbatim. |
| `test_runCommand_fetch_failed_path` | Mock handler throws `TypeError("fetch failed")`; assert exit 1, `cli_error` with `error_code = "API_UNREACHABLE"`, the message includes `ctx.apiUrl`. |
| `test_runCommand_unexpected_path` | Mock handler throws a plain `Error("boom")`; assert exit 1, `cli_error` with `error_code = "UNEXPECTED"`, the message is the original string. |
| `test_runCommand_emits_lifecycle_triplet` | Successful handler; assert exactly two events fire — `cli_command_started` then `cli_command_finished` — both carrying the registered command name. |
| `test_runCommand_no_double_emit` | Handler that throws `ApiError`; assert `cli_command_finished` does NOT fire and `cli_error` fires exactly once. |
| `test_audit_cli_runcommand_passes_on_clean_tree` | Run `scripts/audit-cli-runcommand.sh`; expect exit 0 on the post-migration tree. |
| `test_audit_cli_runcommand_fails_on_bypass` | Mutate a fixture registry to bypass `runCommand`; assert audit exits 1 with the offending command in stderr. |
| `test_audit_cli_runcommand_fails_on_missing_code` | Mutate a fixture `errorMap` to drop an expected code; assert audit exits 1 listing the missing code. |
| `test_cli_top_level_catch_has_no_ApiError_branch` | Static check on `cli.js` source: asserts no `ApiError` reference outside imports. |
| `test_existing_command_user_visible_strings_unchanged` | Snapshot test: invoke `commandSteer` (and 2-3 other commands) against a stub server returning known UZ-* codes; assert stderr matches the pre-migration snapshot byte-for-byte. Guards against accidental error-string drift. |
| `test_telemetry_off_by_default` | `resolveConfig({})` (empty env) resolves to `enabled: false` even though `DEFAULT_POSTHOG_KEY.length > 0`; `createCliAnalytics({})` returns `null` and never imports `posthog-node`. |
| `test_disable_telemetry_one_keeps_off` | `resolveConfig({ DISABLE_TELEMETRY: "1" })` resolves to `enabled: false`. Same for `"true"`, `"on"`, `"yes"`. |
| `test_disable_telemetry_zero_opts_in` | `resolveConfig({ DISABLE_TELEMETRY: "0" })` resolves to `enabled: true`; `createCliAnalytics({ DISABLE_TELEMETRY: "0" })` returns a non-null client. Same for `"false"`, `"off"`, `"no"`. |
| `test_zombie_posthog_enabled_no_longer_recognized` | `resolveConfig({ ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED: "true" })` resolves to `enabled: false` — the renamed flag is the only on-switch; the legacy name is dead. |
| `test_no_legacy_env_var_in_tree` | `grep -rn 'ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_ENABLED' zombiectl/ | grep -v 'docs/v2/done'` returns zero matches after the migration commit lands. |

Fixtures: `zombiectl/test/commands/error-map.fixture.js`, `zombiectl/test/commands/snapshots/{command}.txt`. Fixture names carry no milestone IDs (RULE TST-NAM).

## Dead Code Sweep

After §3 lands, the inline `ApiError` / `fetch failed` formatting in `cli.js` is unreachable. Remove it in the same commit (RULE NDC). No file deletions; only branch removals.

| Deleted symbol or import | Grep command | Expected |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------|
| Inline `ApiError` branch in `cli.js` top-level catch | `grep -n 'ApiError' zombiectl/src/cli.js \| grep -v import` | 0 matches |
| Inline `fetch failed` branch in `cli.js` top-level catch | `grep -n 'fetch failed' zombiectl/src/cli.js` | 0 matches |
| Per-handler `printApiError` calls | `grep -rn 'printApiError(' zombiectl/src/commands/` | 0 matches (lib uses are fine) |

## Skill-Driven Review Chain (mandatory)

| When | Skill | What it does | Required output |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| After implementation, before CHORE(close) | `/write-unit-test` | Audits coverage of the migrated registry + `errorMap` paths against this spec's Test Specification. | Returns clean. |
| After tests pass, before CHORE(close) | `/review` | Adversarial diff review against this spec, REST guidelines (for UZ-* code coverage), Failure Modes, Invariants. Catches snapshot drift, missing codes, dead branches in `cli.js`. | Returns clean OR every finding dispositioned. |
| After `gh pr create` | `/review-pr` | Comments on the open PR; catches anything `/review` missed post-rebase (registry import path drift, fixture rebase conflicts). | Comments addressed inline. |
| After every push to the PR | `kishore-babysit-prs` | Polls greptile per cadence; classifies findings; suppresses against history. Stops on two consecutive empty polls. | Final report in PR Session Notes. |

## Out of Scope

- Migrating handlers to a fully `(ctx)`-only signature. Today handlers receive `(ctx, args, workspaces, deps)`; this spec preserves that shape. Reshaping is its own workstream when (and if) the registry-side adapter becomes load-bearing.
- Per-step `try/catch` removal inside long poll loops (login pairing, browser-launch). Those keep their per-step recovery and only their outer dispatch goes through `runCommand`.
- Adding new UZ-* error codes server-side. The `errorMap` mirrors what already exists; new codes are introduced by their own spec and added to the maps as part of that change.
- `streamFetch` / SSE retry policy. SSE has different semantics; today's behavior carries forward unchanged. A future spec may revisit if SSE failures become a hot path.
- Telemetry **transport** changes. The PostHog destination, bundled project key, and `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_KEY`/`ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_HOST` overrides stay unchanged; only the on/off control surface and its default flip in §0.
- Removing the bundled default PostHog project key. With the default flipped to off, the bundled key is harmless. Removing it would force operators who opt in (`DISABLE_TELEMETRY=0`) to also supply `ZOMBIE_POSTHOG_KEY`, which is its own decision.
- Re-introducing M63_002's interactive consent prompt. The default-off flip subsumes the privacy goal of M63_002 with a smaller blast radius.
