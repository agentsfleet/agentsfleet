# M71_001: Trigger Panel multi-card + Provider Guidance + Website OnboardingFlow + Hero CTA (M68 deferred UI/website work)

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M71
**Workstream:** 001
**Date:** May 18, 2026
**Status:** DONE
**Priority:** P2 — completes the M68 trigger DX surface (per-trigger cards, provider guidance table, OnboardingFlow, Hero CTA) that was deferred during M68's CHORE(close), plus §7 hero promo pill (Captain ask, in-PR amendment May 18, 2026), plus §8–§11 + §13 post-audit dashboard follow-ups (Captain ask, May 20, 2026; API-keys self-service split out to M76_001). Not blocking any other workstream.
**Categories:** UI, WEBSITE
**Batch:** B1
**Branch:** feat/m71-001-p2-trigger-panel-onboarding-flow
**Depends on:** M68_001 (DONE) — this spec inherits the unfinished M68 §D / §E / §G surface listed in M68's "Deferred to follow-up" section.
**Provenance:** agent-generated. Original M71_001 P2 spec (May 17, 2026) bundled CLI login resilience (§1-§5: countdown, hydration warning, error-code split, exp-backoff polling, single-blip tolerance) AND dashboard / website UX work (§6-§11). On May 18, 2026 the CLI portion was **absorbed into M74_002** (CLI Browser Authorization Flow consolidation) — including the M68-deferred dimensions D20/D21/D24/D25/D26/D32 originally listed in this spec's Out of Scope. This spec was renamed from `M71_001_P2_CLI_LOGIN_RESILIENCE_AND_UX_POLISH.md` to its current name and scoped down to the dashboard / website residue. The original §6-§11 content is preserved verbatim below; only the surrounding framing changed.

**Canonical architecture:** N/A — this is dashboard + website UX polish, no architecture-doc surface.

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. `docs/v2/done/M68_001_P1_API_CLI_UI_DOCS_WEBSITE_TRIGGER_REGISTRATION_AND_FREE_TRIAL.md` §13 — the parent spec's "Deferred to follow-up" list names each section's design intent and references the carrying-forward files. Treat that prose as the contract this spec inherits.
2. `ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/zombies/[id]/components/TriggerPanel.tsx` — current M68-shipped 2-tab UI (Webhook tab + Schedule tab). Reshape into per-trigger card list per §1.
3. `ui/packages/app/tests/zombies.test.ts` (the `describe("TriggerPanel interactions")` block, ~line 690) — existing tests stay green after this spec lands; new tests live in the dedicated `TriggerPanel.test.ts`.
4. `ui/packages/website/src/pages/Home.tsx` + `ui/packages/website/src/components/Hero.tsx` + `ui/packages/website/src/components/FeatureFlow.tsx` — current website Home state. §4 (OnboardingFlow) and §5 (Hero CTA) modify these.
5. M68_001 §"`OnboardingFlow.tsx` design" (line 398) and §"`provider-guidance.ts` schema" (line 371) — verbatim design blocks the implementer copies into the new files.

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`** — universal repo discipline (RULE NDC, RULE NSQ, RULE UFS, RULE TST-NAM, RULE FLL).
- **`zombiectl/CLAUDE.md`** — N/A; this spec touches `ui/packages/app/` and `ui/packages/website/` only, not the CLI.
- **TS strict settings** — every new `.tsx` / `.ts` file must compile under the existing `ui/packages/app/tsconfig.json` and `ui/packages/website/tsconfig.json` settings. No `as any`, `!`, or `@ts-expect-error` added.
- `docs/ZIG_RULES.md`, `docs/SCHEMA_CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` — N/A; this spec is UI/website-only; no server-side surface touched.
- `docs/AUTH.md` — N/A; CLI login flow lives in M74_002. This spec does NOT modify auth.

---

## Overview

**Goal (testable):** the dashboard renders one card per declared trigger (webhook variants per known provider via `GuidedTriggerCard`; cron via `CronCard`; unknown sources fall back to the existing Copy-URL pattern). The website Home page gains a 4-card pictorial `OnboardingFlow` and the Hero CTA becomes a clipboard-write + toast + smooth-scroll affordance pointing at the OnboardingFlow anchor. All four pieces close the M68 "Deferred to follow-up" list.

**Problem:** M68_001 shipped a minimal 2-tab TriggerPanel (Webhook + Schedule placeholder) and a 3-row evidence-layout `FeatureFlow` on Home as a stand-in for the spec'd 4-card pictorial. The provider-guidance data table (`PROVIDER_GUIDANCE`), the `GuidedTriggerCard`, the `CronCard`, the website `OnboardingFlow`, and the Hero CTA redesign were all listed in M68's "Deferred to follow-up" but did not land before close.

**Solution summary:** Five focused sections, each carrying its own design block copied verbatim from M68:

- **§1** — TriggerPanel switches from tabs to per-trigger card list.
- **§2** — `provider-guidance.ts` data table with six (or seven) provider entries.
- **§3** — `GuidedTriggerCard.tsx` (State B — known provider).
- **§4** — `CronCard.tsx` (read-only cron display).
- **§5** — Website `OnboardingFlow.tsx` (4-card pictorial) + Home mount.
- **§6** — `Hero.tsx` primary-CTA redesign (clipboard + toast + smooth-scroll).

No server-side surface touched. No new HTTP endpoints. No schema changes. No new dependencies beyond a lightweight cron-parsing library if §4 chooses to use one.

(The API-keys page that would have edited `src/http/handlers/api_keys/tenant.zig` is split out to M76_001.)

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — Trigger panel multi-card switch (M68 §D / §E1 / §F4)

**Provenance:** M68_001 §D narrative (line 73) + §E1 (line 128) + §F4 (line 141). Spec intent preserved verbatim below; implementing agent has the design ready.

**What M68 said the trigger panel should do:** "`TriggerPanel.tsx` renders one card per declared trigger in `zombie.triggers[]`. Card variants: `GuidedTriggerCard` (known webhook provider; pre-renders terminal registration command), `CopyUrlCard` (unknown source; today's behaviour as fallback), `CronCard` (schedule + next fire), `ApiCard` (catch-all `POST /v1/zombies/{id}/events` ingress)." `type: api` was carved out (§E5 / Out of Scope); `ApiCard.tsx` is **not** in scope for this spec either — it lands with the workspace-API-tokens spec. The four in-scope variants for M71_001 P2 are `GuidedTriggerCard`, `CopyUrlCard` (already conceptually in the shipped Tabs UI as the default Webhook tab), `CronCard`, and the per-trigger loop in `TriggerPanel.tsx` itself.

**What shipped in M68:** a 78-line 2-tab UI (Webhook tab with one URL + Copy button; Schedule tab with "Cron scheduling is CLI-only for V1" placeholder). Tested at `ui/packages/app/tests/zombies.test.ts:690` (`describe("TriggerPanel interactions")` with three rows — copy semantics + cron-placeholder visibility). Those existing tests stay green after this section lands (the Tabs UI either remains as the "no triggers declared" fallback or its assertions move to assert the new per-card layout — implementing agent decides at design time).

**What this section delivers:**

| Sub-dim | File | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | `ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/zombies/[id]/components/TriggerPanel.tsx` | EDIT | Switch from `<Tabs defaultValue="webhook">…</Tabs>` to `<>{zombie.triggers.map(t => <Card variant={t.type, t.source} t={t} />)}</>`. Footer prose: "Edit `TRIGGER.md` and reinstall to change triggers — the source markdown is the source of truth." Prop signature changes from `{ zombieId: string }` to `{ zombieId: string; triggers: ZombieTrigger[] }` (parent page already has `zombie.triggers` from the M68 list-projection change). |
| 1.2 | `ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/zombies/[id]/components/TriggerPanel.test.ts` | EDIT (move from `tests/zombies.test.ts:690` *or* extend in place) | Multi-card-variant rows: (a) 3-trigger zombie → 3 cards in order; (b) `source: "weirdco"` → falls back to `CopyUrlCard`; (c) last-delivery line populates from `listZombieEvents(actor_prefix, limit:1)`. Preserve the existing Tabs-UI test assertions if those code paths remain. |

**Acceptance:** an authenticated user installs a zombie with `triggers: [{type: webhook, source: github, events: ["push"]}, {type: cron, schedule: "*/15 * * * *"}]` → `/zombies/{id}` renders TriggerPanel with exactly two cards in order: a `GuidedTriggerCard` for the github webhook (uses §3) and a `CronCard` for the cron (uses §4).

### §2 — `provider-guidance.ts` data table + tests (M68 §E2 / §F3)

**Provenance:** M68_001 §E2 (line 129) + §F3 (line 140) + §"`provider-guidance.ts` schema" (line 371). Verbatim design carried forward; M71 P2 implementer ships the table.

**What M68 said:** "Static `PROVIDER_GUIDANCE: Record<Source, GuidanceCard>` map. Entries for `github`, `linear`, `jira`, `grafana`, `slack`, `agentmail`. Each defines: title, events-label formatter, terminal-command template, web-User-Interface deep-link template, user-input variable list (e.g. `OWNER/REPO`, `TEAM_ID`, `WORKSPACE`)." Note: M68 also planned a `clerk` entry as a deep-link-only variant (line 371) — that brings the count to seven providers if the M71 implementer chooses to include it; minimum six per the §E2 row.

**Schema** (TypeScript — copy verbatim from M68 §371 onward when implementing):

```typescript
type Source = "github" | "linear" | "jira" | "grafana" | "slack" | "agentmail" | "clerk";

type GuidanceCard = {
  title: string;
  eventsLabel: (events: string[]) => string;        // e.g. ["push","pull_request"] → "On push, pull_request"
  command: (vars: Record<string, string>, webhookUrl: string, events: readonly string[]) => string;
  webUiDeepLink: (vars: Record<string, string>) => string;
  variables: Array<{ name: string; example: string; required: boolean }>;
};

// NOTE: the `command` callback takes a 3rd `events` arg so per-provider templates
// can vary the rendered command by trigger.events (e.g. GitHub's `-F events[]=push`
// list) without re-deriving them inside the closure. The original M68 §line 122 sketch
// was 2-arg; landing under this spec widens the signature with rationale per
// CLAUDE.md "signature change → update spec first".

export const PROVIDER_GUIDANCE: Record<Source, GuidanceCard>;
```

**Per-provider verbatim content** lives in M68 §"`provider-guidance.ts` schema" (line 371 onward). Implementer copies that block into the new file.

**Files:**

| Sub-dim | File | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | `ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/zombies/[id]/components/provider-guidance.ts` | NEW | The data table. RULE FLL — if it crosses 350 lines, split per provider into `provider-guidance/{github,linear,jira,grafana,slack,agentmail,clerk}.ts` with a `mod.ts` aggregator (M68's note at §line 315 stays binding). |
| 2.2 | `ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/zombies/[id]/components/provider-guidance.test.ts` | NEW | Per-provider snapshot test: given `triggers[0] = {source, events}` + webhook URL, the rendered command + deep-link strings match a fixture. Pins prose. Six (or seven) fixture files alongside. |

**Acceptance:** `PROVIDER_GUIDANCE.github` rendering a `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/hooks` command with the M68 webhook URL substituted matches the fixture byte-for-byte.

### §3 — `GuidedTriggerCard.tsx` (M68 §E3)

**Provenance:** M68_001 §E3 (line 130).

**What M68 said:** "Renders State B (known provider). Composes events label, webhook URL with Copy button, rendered command block with Copy button, web-UI deep link, last-delivery line. Pure presentational."

**File:** `ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/zombies/[id]/components/GuidedTriggerCard.tsx` — NEW.

**Props (suggested):**

```typescript
type Props = {
  trigger: ZombieTrigger;          // type === "webhook"
  webhookUrl: string;
  guidance: GuidanceCard;          // PROVIDER_GUIDANCE[trigger.source]
  lastDeliveryAt?: number | null;  // from listZombieEvents(actor_prefix, limit:1)
};
```

**Composition** (top-to-bottom in the card):

1. Header: `guidance.title` + `guidance.eventsLabel(trigger.events ?? [])`.
2. Webhook URL row: copyable code block (use the M68 shipped TriggerPanel's copy-button pattern — `useState<boolean>` + `navigator.clipboard.writeText` + 1.5s reset).
3. Rendered command block: variable inputs above (one per `guidance.variables`), the rendered `guidance.command(vars, webhookUrl)` below, Copy button. The command re-renders client-side as the user types into the variable inputs.
4. Web-UI deep link: `<a href={guidance.webUiDeepLink(vars)} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">` with the provider name.
5. Last-delivery line: `Last delivery: <relative-time>` if `lastDeliveryAt`; otherwise `Last delivery: never`.

**Pure presentational** — no data fetching inside; the parent (`TriggerPanel.tsx`) passes `webhookUrl` + `guidance` + `lastDeliveryAt` down.

### §4 — `CronCard.tsx` (M68 §E4)

**Provenance:** M68_001 §E4 (line 131).

**What M68 said:** "Renders cron triggers. Shows the schedule, next-fire computed client-side (timezone-aware), and links the user to Recent Activity filtered `actor LIKE 'cron:%'`. ~50 lines."

**File:** `ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/zombies/[id]/components/CronCard.tsx` — NEW.

**Props:** `{ trigger: ZombieTrigger /* type === "cron" */; zombieId: string }`.

**Composition:**

1. Header: `Cron — ${trigger.schedule}` (the raw cron expression).
2. Next-fire line: computed client-side from the cron expression + `Date.now()` + IANA tz from `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`. Implementer picks a lightweight cron-parsing dep (`cron-parser` is ~9 kB minified; check bundle budget against the website's `.size-limit.json` 140 kB asserted ceiling).
3. "Cron is read-only in the Dashboard" prose: "Declared in TRIGGER.md, runtime-managed by NullClaw's `cron_add` tool. Edit `TRIGGER.md` and reinstall to change the schedule." Mirrors the Out-of-Scope note from M68 line 993.
4. Recent-activity filter link: `<Link href={\`/zombies/${zombieId}?actor_prefix=cron:\`}>View cron deliveries →</Link>`.

### §5 — Website `OnboardingFlow` (M68 §G5 / §G6 / §G7)

**Provenance:** M68_001 §G5 (line 153) + §G6 (line 154) + §G7 (line 155) + §"`OnboardingFlow.tsx` design" (line 398).

**Coexistence with `FeatureFlow.tsx`** (implementer decision at PLAN time):

`FeatureFlow.tsx` shipped at M68 in the slot OnboardingFlow was supposed to fill (`Home.tsx:40`). FeatureFlow is a 3-row alternating evidence layout (install / event-trace / mission-control); OnboardingFlow as spec'd is a 4-card horizontally-laid pictorial step-by-step (install / run skill / wire webhook / steer). Two valid dispositions:

- **(a) Replace** `FeatureFlow` with `OnboardingFlow` on `Home.tsx` (the original M68 intent); delete `FeatureFlow.tsx` and its tests; reroute any other call sites of `FeatureFlow` to OnboardingFlow.
- **(b) Coexist** — keep `FeatureFlow` as the evidence section, mount `OnboardingFlow` either above it (between Hero and FeatureFlow) or below Pricing per M68's original placement. Two distinct sections with different user goals (evidence-of-product vs step-by-step-getting-started).

Disposition (a) is closer to the M68 design intent; disposition (b) preserves the post-M68 shipped state and adds the missing pictorial. Implementer picks at PLAN with `plan-ceo-review` or `plan-design-review` input; default is (a).

**File spec (carried forward from M68 §line 398):** "`OnboardingFlow.tsx` renders four horizontally-laid cards on desktop, stacked on mobile. Each card carries: an icon, a 1-line label, a code snippet (real shell command — `npm install -g @usezombie/zombiectl`, `npx skills add usezombie/usezombie`, `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/hooks -F …`, `zombiectl steer zom_… 'howdy'`), and a sub-caption (≤2 lines explaining when the user runs it). ~180 LOC, no images — typography + design-system tokens only."

The four cards (verbatim from M68 §G5):

1. `npm install -g @usezombie/zombiectl` + `npx skills add usezombie/usezombie`.
2. Run `/usezombie-install-platform-ops` in Claude (or paste `TRIGGER.md` + `SKILL.md` in the Dashboard).
3. Wire the webhook (`gh api` one-liner pre-rendered; or copy the command from the Dashboard).
4. Steer the zombie ("howdy" from terminal `zombiectl steer` or from the Dashboard chat composer).

**Files:**

| Sub-dim | File | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | `ui/packages/website/src/components/OnboardingFlow.tsx` | NEW (~180 LOC). |
| 5.2 | `ui/packages/website/src/components/OnboardingFlow.test.tsx` | NEW — snapshot test for the four cards; deterministic rendering. Asserts (a) four cards rendered in numbered order, (b) each card contains the expected code snippet text. |
| 5.3 | `ui/packages/website/src/pages/Home.tsx` | EDIT — mount `<OnboardingFlow />` per the chosen disposition (a) or (b). |
| 5.4 | `ui/packages/website/src/components/FeatureFlow.tsx` + `FeatureFlow.test.tsx` (if disposition (a)) | DELETE — only if FeatureFlow is fully replaced; carry FeatureFlow's existing tests into the OnboardingFlow test surface where they overlap (the install-command card is in both). |

**Anchor:** the section's outer container gets `id="onboarding-flow"` so §6's smooth-scroll target works after this lands.

### §6 — `Hero.tsx` primary-CTA redesign (M68 §G11)

**Provenance:** M68_001 §G11 (line 159).

**What M68 said:** Replace the `<a href={DOCS_QUICKSTART_URL}>` "→ install in Claude Code" button with a `<button>` whose onClick (a) writes `npm install -g @usezombie/zombiectl && npx skills add usezombie/usezombie` to `navigator.clipboard`, (b) shows a 2-second "Copied — paste into your terminal" toast (existing design-system `<Toast>` or an `aria-live` region fallback), (c) smooth-scrolls to the `#onboarding-flow` anchor on the same page. Keep `DOCS_QUICKSTART_URL` as a small tertiary "read the full quickstart →" link inside OnboardingFlow itself (§5). Update `Hero.test.tsx:52-56` accordingly.

**Depends on §5** — the `#onboarding-flow` anchor must exist before the scroll target makes sense. Land §5 first or in the same PR.

**File:** `ui/packages/website/src/components/Hero.tsx` — EDIT lines around 64–70 (per M68's pinned range; verify line numbers at PLAN time since intervening edits may have shifted them).

**Tests:** `Hero.test.tsx:52-56` — assert (a) clicking the CTA writes the install command to a mocked clipboard, (b) the toast appears for ~2s then disappears, (c) `scrollIntoView` is called on the `#onboarding-flow` element.

---

### §7 — Hero promo pill (Pioneer-pattern, in-PR amendment May 18, 2026)

**Provenance:** in-PR Captain ask on PR #330. The free-trial pricing posture ("Free until July 31, 2026 — every event receipt and stage execution is on us") already lives on the pricing component (`Pricing.tsx` consuming `RATES_DISPLAY.FREE_TRIAL_BANNER`) but is invisible above the fold on the landing page. The promo is concrete, time-bound, and asymmetrically converting vs the generic "try for free" framing — the landing should make it explicit.

**What lands:** between the LIVE eyebrow `<p data-testid="hero-eyebrow">` and the `<h1 data-testid="hero-headline">` in `Hero.tsx`, render a React Router `<Link to="/pricing">` styled as a small mono pill carrying a `Promo` lozenge + the short trial-end string + an aria-hidden `→`. Shape mirrors Pioneer's "Free inference on Opus 4.7 until Aug 1 →" pattern. Pill text is **derived from the rates pin**, not hardcoded in `Hero.tsx`.

**Rates-pin coupling:** `ui/packages/website/src/lib/rates.ts` is the source of truth for the trial-end display string. A new `RATES_DISPLAY.FREE_TRIAL_PILL` ("Free until July 31, 2026") is added; both `FREE_TRIAL_BANNER` (pricing) and `FREE_TRIAL_PILL` (hero) consume a single internal `FREE_TRIAL_END_DISPLAY` substring so the date can never drift between hero and pricing. The numeric `FREE_TRIAL_END_MS` constant remains the cross-tier-pinned source (audit-cross-tier-rates.sh enforces it across Zig + 3 TS surfaces); the display string is a TS-only display-layer mirror.

**File:** `ui/packages/website/src/components/Hero.tsx` — EDIT, insert between the existing eyebrow `<p>` and `<h1>` blocks (~lines 78–91 post-§6).

**Design tokens (no arbitrary values, DESIGN TOKEN GATE compliant):**
- Container: `inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-card border border-border px-3 py-1 text-sm font-mono text-text-muted hover:text-text transition-colors w-fit`
- `Promo` lozenge: `rounded-full bg-pulse text-pulse-fg px-2 py-0.5 text-xs uppercase tracking-eyebrow font-medium`
- Trailing `→` is `aria-hidden="true"`; the link's accessible name is its text content.

**Tests:** `Hero.test.tsx` — assert (a) pill renders with `data-testid="hero-promo-pill"`, (b) it is an `<a>` with `href="/pricing"`, (c) it contains the literal "Free until July 31, 2026" string sourced from `RATES_DISPLAY.FREE_TRIAL_PILL`, (d) the pill renders before the `<h1>` in document order (DOM-position check, not snapshot). `rates.test.ts` — assert (e) `RATES_DISPLAY.FREE_TRIAL_PILL` equals the exact pin string, (f) the pill string and the banner string share the same `"July 31, 2026"` date substring (single-source-of-truth invariant).

**Acceptance:** the existing 12 Hero.test.tsx rows continue to pass byte-for-byte (no §6 regression); 4 new rows green; rates.test.ts gains 2 rows.

## §8–§11, §13 — Post-audit dashboard follow-ups (Captain ask, May 20, 2026)

**Provenance:** during PR #330 review the Captain requested a full dashboard route/navigation audit. The audit surfaced five gaps. Four are fixed in this PR — §8 Clerk input contrast, §9 dev-route removal, §10 branded Spinner, §11 create-workspace UI — plus §13, a read-only `ui/` dependency-freshness audit. The fifth (Tenant API Keys self-service UI) was briefly folded in as §12, then **split back into its own spec M76_001 / PR** at the Captain's call (security boundary + backend + e2e — see the §12 note below). Nothing in this PR touches M74_002's reserved surface (`zombiectl/`, `src/auth/`, `src/http/handlers/auth/`, `ui/packages/app/lib/auth/`) — `lib/auth/` is consumed (`getServerSessionMetadata`/`getServerAuth`), never edited.

### §8 — Clerk sign-in input contrast fix

**Problem:** `ui/packages/app/lib/clerkAppearance.ts` themes both the card surface (`cardBox.backgroundColor`) and the input fields (`formFieldInput.backgroundColor`) with the same `var(--surface-2)` token. With no luminance delta between the card and the inputs sitting on it, the text boxes are visually invisible — the operator cannot tell where to click (Captain: "its black and I didn't know where to click").

**What lands:** give `formFieldInput` its own surface + a visible border so the click target reads as an input. Use `var(--surface-1)` for the field fill (one step darker than the `--surface-2` card) plus `borderColor: var(--border-strong)`. Inputs now separate from the card. No new tokens — both already exist in `theme.css`.

**Acceptance:** `clerkAppearance.test.ts` (new or extended) asserts `formFieldInput.backgroundColor !== cardBox.backgroundColor` (the regression that caused the bug) and that `formFieldInput.borderColor` is set.

### §9 — Remove `/ds-button-rsc` dev route

**Problem:** `app/(dev)/ds-button-rsc/page.tsx` is a public, unauthenticated route that ships to production and is reachable by URL.

**Decision (Captain, May 20, 2026):** delete it. An interim gate (`notFound()` in production, keep the build fixture) was considered because `vitest.config.ts` documented the route as a build-time RSC-safe assertion for the design-system `Button`. The Captain directed full removal. Verified the guard is **redundant**: `Button` carries no `"use client"` directive (RSC-safe by construction) and is already rendered in real server components — `settings/billing/components/BillingBalanceCard.tsx` and `approvals/[gateId]/page.tsx` — so the contract stays exercised by production code without a dedicated fixture.

**What lands:** delete the `app/(dev)/` route group, its dev-fixture test, and the now-dead `**/ds-button-rsc/**` coverage exclude in `vitest.config.ts`.

**Acceptance:** `find app/\(dev\)` returns nothing; `grep -rn ds-button-rsc app vitest.config.ts` returns nothing; app tests + typecheck stay green (Button RSC usage in BillingBalanceCard / approvals detail still compiles).

### §10 — Branded loader (`Spinner` via `WakePulse`)

**Problem:** loading affordances are inconsistent. The brand wake-pulse appears only as the header/sign-in "live" dot; in-flight loaders use Lucide's generic `Loader2Icon` (`/zombies` loading, BillingUsageTab "Load more", InstallZombieForm submit, etc.) while `/approvals`, `/settings`, `/events` use `Skeleton`. The generic spinner is off-brand.

**What lands:** add a `Spinner` primitive to `@usezombie/design-system` built on the existing `WakePulse` glow-ring keyframe (a sized, `aria-busy` brand pulse). Swap the `Loader2Icon`-as-spinner usages in the dashboard to `Spinner`. **Skeleton placeholders stay** — they are layout-shape loaders, a different affordance, and are already consistent. The decision (pulse for indeterminate "working", skeleton for "page-shape pending") is documented in the component docstring.

**Acceptance:** `Spinner.test.tsx` asserts it renders the pulse element with `role="status"` / `aria-busy`. No remaining `Loader2Icon` import in dashboard spinner sites (Skeleton untouched). DESIGN TOKEN GATE clean (pulse tokens, no arbitraries).

### §11 — Create-workspace UI

**Problem:** the backend exposes `POST /v1/workspaces` (bearer, `invokeCreateWorkspace` → `ws_lifecycle.innerCreateWorkspace`) but the dashboard has no create affordance — workspaces only ever come from the Clerk signup webhook. A tenant that lands without a workspace, or wants a second, is stuck.

**Backend contract (verified, unchanged):** `POST /v1/workspaces`, body `{ name?: string }` (empty/blank → server picks a Heroku-style name), → `201 { workspace_id, name, request_id }`. Errors: `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST` (malformed JSON), `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` (missing/unknown tenant on session).

**What lands:** a "New workspace" entry in the existing `WorkspaceSwitcher` dropdown (header) opening a dialog with an optional name field; submit calls a server action wrapping `POST /v1/workspaces`, then switches the active-workspace cookie to the new id and revalidates. `lib/api/workspaces.ts` gains `createTenantWorkspace(token, { name? })`.

**Acceptance:** unit test for the client + server action happy path and the `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` mapping; WorkspaceSwitcher test asserts the "New workspace" item renders and opens the dialog.

> **§12 — Tenant API Keys self-service settings page — SPLIT OUT (Captain, May 20, 2026).** Originally folded here as §12, then split back into its own spec **M76_001** (restored to `docs/v2/pending/`) for its own PR. Rationale: it crosses a security boundary (operator RBAC + one-time raw-secret reveal + "raw key never in DOM/logs"), carries a backend `tenant.zig` comment edit + Playwright e2e, and wants the AUTH review chain — a materially different review profile than the UI polish in this PR. M76_001 carries the full plan/contract/failure-modes/invariants/test-spec. This PR does **not** touch `/settings/api-keys` or `src/http/handlers/api_keys/`.

### §13 — Punch list: `ui/` dependency freshness audit (Captain ask, May 20, 2026)

Audit of `package.json` across the three `ui/` workspace packages, **with the audited bumps then applied in this PR** — on May 20, 2026 the Captain reversed the initial read-only stance and folded the dependency refresh into this diff rather than spinning a separate `chore(deps)` PR. Every package in the table below was moved to its **Latest** value; `cron-parser` was added for §4's `CronCard` and the now-dead `@radix-ui/react-toast` dropped.

**Finding (`bun outdated`, May 20, 2026):** healthy — every package is within one **minor/patch** of latest; **zero major-version drift**.

| Package | Current | Latest | Δ | Packages |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@clerk/nextjs` | 7.3.4 | 7.3.7 | patch | app |
| `posthog-js` | 1.373.4 | 1.374.2 | patch | app, website |
| `react-hook-form` | 7.75.0 | 7.76.0 | minor | app, design-system |
| `@clerk/testing` (dev) | 2.0.28 | 2.0.31 | patch | app |
| `svix` (dev) | 1.93.0 | 1.94.0 | minor | app |
| `oxlint` (dev) | 1.64.0 | 1.66.0 | minor | all three |
| `oxlint-tsgolint` (dev) | 0.22.1 | 0.23.0 | minor | app |
| `@types/node` / `@types/react` (dev) | 25.8.0 / 19.2.14 | 25.9.1 / 19.2.15 | patch | all three |

**Outcome:** the applied bumps are all minor/patch — zero major-version drift. `next` / `react` / `tailwindcss` / `vitest` were already at latest (absent from the outdated list). The refresh followed the repo rule that "latest" means the version the reference toolchain pins, not blind npm-latest, with the full verify tier (lint + typecheck + coverage across all three packages) run green after.

No HTTP / OpenAPI / wire surface added or changed. No new dashboard or website routes. The contracts this spec locks:

```typescript
// TriggerPanel prop signature changes (§1.1):
type TriggerPanelProps = {
  zombieId: string;
  triggers: ZombieTrigger[];   // NEW — parent passes from zombie.triggers
};

// PROVIDER_GUIDANCE export (§2): GuidanceCard.command is 3-arg
// (vars, webhookUrl, events) — see §2 schema block.
export const PROVIDER_GUIDANCE: Record<Source, GuidanceCard>;

// OnboardingFlow component (§5):
export function OnboardingFlow(): JSX.Element;  // pure presentational
```

No new flags. No new env vars. No new dependencies beyond a lightweight cron-parsing library at §4 implementer's discretion.

---

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Zombie has zero triggers declared | Edge case from M68 spec | TriggerPanel renders a single "No triggers declared" Card with the bare webhook URL as a fallback ingress (via `CopyUrlFallback` source="none"). The M68 Tabs scaffolding is removed by RULE NLR (touch-it-fix-it) — its only remaining caller was this empty-state branch, and dragging it forward solely for that case is dead-code framing. The "user can still find a webhook URL" intent of the M68 row is preserved. |
| `trigger.source` not in `PROVIDER_GUIDANCE` keyset | Unknown / new provider | TriggerPanel renders `CopyUrlCard` (existing M68 fallback shape). |
| Cron expression unparseable | Bad TRIGGER.md input | CronCard shows the raw expression in the header + a "schedule unparseable — check `TRIGGER.md`" warning line in place of next-fire. |
| `navigator.clipboard.writeText` rejects (insecure context / permission denied) | Browser restricts clipboard access | Fallback to a visible "Copy this command:" prose block with the command selectable; the toast still fires but with prose "Selected — copy manually." |
| `scrollIntoView` no-op (anchor missing because §5 didn't land yet) | §6 lands before §5 | §6 PR must include §5; the dependency is documented. CI test for §6 asserts `#onboarding-flow` exists in the rendered Home page. |
| Bundle-size regression beyond the website's 140 kB landing-js ceiling (`ui/packages/website/.size-limit.json`) | `cron-parser` or other §4 dep | Implementer measures pre-/post-bundle size; if over budget, swap for a smaller cron parser or roll a minimal expression-only formatter. |
| Hero promo pill date drifts from `RATES_DISPLAY.FREE_TRIAL_BANNER` date | Someone edits the pill string without touching the banner (or vice versa) | Both consume a single private `FREE_TRIAL_END_DISPLAY` substring in `rates.ts`. `rates.test.ts` pins the shared substring; drift fails the test. |
| Hero promo pill date drifts from `FREE_TRIAL_END_MS` numeric pin | Someone bumps `FREE_TRIAL_END_MS` (Zig + 3 TS surfaces, audit-cross-tier-rates.sh enforced) but forgets the display string | Out-of-scope automation for now; the rates.ts module-level comment names the coupling, the audit script flags numeric drift, and the human PR review is the catch for the display string until a future spec adds a `FREE_TRIAL_END_MS → display` derivation. |
| §11 create-workspace: empty/blank name submitted | User leaves the name field blank | Backend picks a Heroku-style name (`{}` body path); UI treats blank as "let server name it" — no client-side rejection. |
| §11 create-workspace: `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` (missing/unknown tenant) | Stale session / unprovisioned Clerk metadata | Server action surfaces a "Couldn't create workspace …" toast; no cookie switch on failure. |

---

## Invariants

1. **No `zombiectl/` file is touched by this spec.** Enforced by RULE NLR (touch-it-fix-it) — anything that asks for CLI changes belongs in M74_002 or a different spec.
2. **No file added or modified by this spec exceeds 350 lines.** Enforced by RULE FLL pre-commit hook. The provider-guidance table splits per-provider if it grows.
3. **The M68 shipped `TriggerPanel` test rows continue to pass** (or their assertions move to the new TriggerPanel.test.ts with equivalent coverage). No regression of M68 acceptance.
4. **No `as any` / `!` / `@ts-expect-error` introduced.** Enforced by `bun run lint` + `bun run typecheck`.
5. **Hero promo pill date string is never hardcoded in `Hero.tsx`.** §7. Pill consumes `RATES_DISPLAY.FREE_TRIAL_PILL` from `rates.ts`. Enforced by code review + rates.test.ts pinning the substring share with `FREE_TRIAL_BANNER`.
6. **`lib/auth/` is consumed, never edited.** §11. Token reads go through the pre-existing `getServerAuth()` / `getServerToken()`; M74_002 owns that directory.
7. **No new HTTP route appears in `src/http/router.zig` or `route_table.zig`.** §11 consumes the existing `POST /v1/workspaces` verbatim; `git diff origin/main -- src/http/router.zig src/http/route_table.zig` stays empty.

- [x] `(cd ui/packages/website && bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun test)` clean.
- [x] `make harness-verify` green (8 gates).
- [x] No new file or modified file in this spec's blast-radius exceeds 350 lines.
- [x] No `as any` / `!` / `@ts-expect-error` added — `git diff origin/main..HEAD -- 'ui/packages/**/*.ts' 'ui/packages/**/*.tsx' | grep -E "as any|@ts-expect-error|: !" | wc -l` == 0.

| `FeatureFlow` component | `grep -rn 'FeatureFlow' ui/packages/website/` | Zero matches |
| `FeatureFlow` test file | `ls ui/packages/website/src/components/FeatureFlow.test.tsx 2>/dev/null` | Not found |

If disposition (b) — coexist — both components remain; no dead-code sweep.

## Discovery (consult log)

**May 17, 2026 — original P2 spec authored.** Bundled CLI login resilience (§1-§5: countdown, hydration warning, error codes, exp-backoff, blip tolerance) with the M68-deferred dashboard/website work (§6-§11). Categories were `CLI, UI, WEBSITE`.

**May 18, 2026 — rescoped.** Captain consolidated every in-flight CLI auth concern into M74_002 (CLI Browser Authorization Flow). The original §1-§5 CLI dimensions (D22 / D23 / D28 / D29 / D30) and the CLI dimensions originally listed in this spec's Out of Scope (D20 / D21 / D24 / D25 / D26 / D32) all moved into M74_002 §5-§6. This spec was renamed from `M71_001_P2_CLI_LOGIN_RESILIENCE_AND_UX_POLISH.md` to `M71_001_P2_UI_WEBSITE_TRIGGER_PANEL_AND_ONBOARDING_FLOW.md`. Categories trimmed to `UI, WEBSITE`. Sections renumbered (former §6-§11 are now §1-§6).

**May 19, 2026 — §7 Option C `/backend` proxy + Redacted + retry hardening dropped, superseded by M74_002 single-token collapse.** A post-merge scope expansion landed on this branch on May 19 ("§7 — API token redaction + retry hardening + Option C /backend proxy", commits `89add737` / `989dda57` / `9e381f2e` / `e8def1ac`). It introduced per-endpoint `/backend/*` route-handler proxies so the browser would never carry the bearer, a `Redacted<string>` wrapper, and an expanded retry layer mirroring `zombiectl/src/lib/http.js`. Two findings forced a reversal:
1. **Build break.** `lib/api/client.ts:serverAuthorizationHeader` dynamically imports `lib/auth/server.ts`, which statically resolves to `@clerk/nextjs/server` and trips Next's `server-only` boundary. `next build` fails on Vercel — `dry-app` / `lint-app` don't catch it because they typecheck rather than bundle. Reproduced locally with `bun run build`.
2. **M74_002 redirected to single-token collapse.** Captain pivoted M74_002 from CLI handshake hardening to the Clerk `sid`-on-custom-template investigation (formerly HANDOFF.md § A.1). If single-token collapse lands, the entire `/backend` BFF + `Redacted` wrapper + `serverAuthorizationHeader` indirection are deleted — the browser carries one cookie-borne JWT and talks to zombied directly.

Rather than fix the `server-only` boundary just to ship code that M74_002 deletes, the §7 commits were dropped from this branch (`git reset --hard b96a153d` then force-push). The hero promo pill §7 (line 242 above) is unaffected and remains DONE. The retry layer reverts to the pre-§7 shape; if M74_002's single-token work needs CLI-parity retries on the dashboard side, it can re-introduce them in its own diff. `tests/e2e/acceptance/events-backfill-proxy.spec.ts` is dropped — the invariant it pinned ("browser carries no bearer") is automatically restored by single-token collapse, where there is no browser-side bearer to leak.

**May 20, 2026 — spec reopened (DONE → IN_PROGRESS) for §8–§12 post-audit follow-ups.** During PR #330 babysitting the Captain asked for a full dashboard route/navigation audit (login → every route, top-right chrome, settings affordances, billing model, Clerk input styling, spinner branding). The audit found five gaps: (§8) Clerk sign-in inputs invisible — card + input both `--surface-2`; (§9) `/ds-button-rsc` public dev route ships to prod; (§10) loaders split between Lucide `Loader2Icon` and the brand pulse; (§11) no create-workspace UI despite a live `POST /v1/workspaces`; (§12) no API-keys self-service UI despite live `operator()`-gated `/v1/api-keys` CRUD. Captain initially said "fix all of them in this PR — I don't want a separate spec," so M76_001 (Tenant API Keys Settings UI) was folded in as §12 and deleted from `pending/`. **Later the same day the Captain reversed that for §12 specifically** — API-keys self-service is split back into its own spec/PR because it crosses a security boundary (operator RBAC + one-time raw-secret reveal + raw-key-never-in-DOM/logs), carries a `tenant.zig` comment edit + Playwright e2e, and wants the AUTH review chain. **M76_001 was restored to `docs/v2/pending/`** and remains the authority for that work. This PR ships §8–§11 + §13 only. Backend contracts for §11 were verified against `route_table.zig` / `router.zig` / `workspaces/lifecycle.zig` (`POST /v1/workspaces` already wired, no new HTTP surface). `lib/auth/` (M74_002's) is consumed, not edited.

**May 20, 2026 — PR review follow-ups + CHORE(close).** Greptile flagged a P1 on `Hero.tsx` (PR #330 discussion r3268698702): the toast passed `null` children the same render `visible` flipped false, so the 240 ms fade played on a blanked element rather than fading the text. Fixed in `0ab9d5fd` — a `lastToast` ref feeds a stable `shown` value to **both** children and severity, matching the design-system Toast "keeps children mounted during the fade window" contract; a mid-fade regression test was added and the dismiss test reworked onto two `act()` boundaries (deterministic, not a single-advance race). Two review-cleanup items landed in `91ee5a26`: the copy-feedback reset delay was unified to a shared `COPY_RESET_MS` (was a bare `1500` in `TriggerPanel`'s `CopyUrlFallback`), and `CreateWorkspaceDialog` now resets its form on close via a `useEffect` cleanup keyed on `open` (a typed-but-cancelled name / stale error otherwise persisted into the next open — covers Cancel, Escape, overlay uniformly). Coverage-strengthening tests landed in `c14ec4c7` (toast warning-severity-through-fade, dialog error-reset, copy-button revert → `TriggerPanel.tsx` to 16/16 funcs). An auto-expand once-guard was prototyped then reverted at the Captain's call: with no client-side re-fetch of triggers, `initiallyOpen` is stable post-mount, so the guard defended a non-occurring case. The §13 dependency refresh was applied in-PR (Captain reversal) and the app coverage gate raised to 97/97/97/97. §8–§11 + §13 plus these follow-ups complete the spec — closed.

## Out of Scope

- **CLI login resilience and polish (D22 / D23 / D28 / D29 / D30)** — absorbed into **M74_002** (CLI Browser Authorization Flow) §6 "Login UX hardening" on May 18, 2026. Originally §1-§5 of this spec.
- **CLI handshake hardening dimensions D20 / D21 / D24 / D25 / D26 / D32** (idempotency check, `--token-name` flag, `/me` ping, argv-leak warning, TTY-priority env resolution, `logout --all` rename) — absorbed into M74_002 §5 on the same date. Originally listed in this spec's Out of Scope as "deferred to the cli-auth handshake hardening sibling spec."
- **§7 Option C `/backend` proxy + Redacted<string> wrapper + retry-layer hardening** — landed on May 19 then dropped before merge. Superseded by M74_002 single-token collapse (the cookie-borne JWT removes the need for a BFF). Investigation memo lives in the Discovery entry above; the four commits (`89add737` / `989dda57` / `9e381f2e` / `e8def1ac`) are preserved on the local backup branch `backup/m71-001-p2-pre-rebase-20260519-234114` and on `origin` until the next force-push, in case M74_002 needs to reference the prior art.
- **`ApiCard.tsx`** (catch-all `POST /v1/zombies/{id}/events` ingress variant from M68 §E5) — lands with the workspace-API-tokens spec, not here.
- **Server-side handshake redesign, `auth_sessions` endpoint shape, token introspection, expiry semantics, revocation** — all in M74_002.
- **PostHog event-schema changes** — no new analytics emits in this spec.
- **`zombiectl/` modifications** — RULE NLR-forbidden in this spec; anything CLI lives in M74_002.
