# M91_002: Category-pinned memory selection — `core` survives the window and the cap

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M91
**Workstream:** 002
**Date:** Jun 11, 2026
**Status:** DONE
**Priority:** P1 — fixes the user-facing forgetting failure: identity facts written once (owner, deploy target, customer plan) are today the FIRST entries both the hydration window and cap eviction discard, because write-recency is the only selection currency
**Categories:** API, DOCS
**Batch:** B2 — after M91_001 (its counters provide the before/after evidence; its `enforceCap` count-return is built on)
**Branch:** feat/m91-002-memory-selection
**Test Baseline:** unit=1912 integration=178
**Depends on:** M91_001 (eviction-count return + loss baselines)
**Provenance:** agent-generated (memory-architecture analysis session, Jun 11, 2026) — grounded in `zombie_memory.zig` (the `Compactor` comment reserves "a future selective arm"), NullClaw's category set (`core`/`daily`/`conversation`/custom), and the supermemory comparison (their static/dynamic profile split solves this same failure); re-confirm at PLAN.

**Canonical architecture:** `docs/architecture/direction.md:20` (no search infrastructure — selection policy is the permitted lever) + `docs/architecture/runner_fleet.md` §Memory continuity + `docs/architecture/capabilities.md` §4 — both describe recency-window hydration and are **reconciled by this workstream in the same diff** (Architecture Consult gate: the doc wins until amended, so the doc edits ship with the behaviour).

---

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. `src/zombied/memory/zombie_memory.zig` — the `Compactor` union and `windowByBytes`; the doc comment explicitly reserves the selective arm this workstream adds. `enforceCap` (post-M91_001 shape) gains the tier ordering.
2. `src/zombied/http/handlers/runner/memory.zig` — `innerRunnerMemoryHydrate` constructs the compactor; the only call-site change.
3. `docs/architecture/capabilities.md` §4 + `docs/architecture/runner_fleet.md` §Memory continuity — the prose being reconciled; read before editing (Architecture Consult gate).
4. `~/Projects/oss/nullclaw/src/memory/root.zig` (`MemoryCategory`: `core`, `daily`, `conversation`, `custom`) — the category vocabulary entries arrive with; durable rows store its `toString` output.
5. `dispatch/write_zig.md` — PUB-surface verdict for the union arm; cross-compile both linux targets.

---

## PR Intent & comprehension handshake

- **PR title (eventual):** `feat(m91): category-pinned hydration + tiered cap eviction`
- **Intent (one sentence):** a zombie's `core` memories are hydrated before any recency windowing and evicted only when nothing else remains, so the facts an agent marked durable stop being the first casualties of the byte budget and the entry cap.
- **Handshake (agent fills at PLAN, before EXECUTE):** restate intent; list `ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:`. Confirm two facts against the branch: (a) the category strings durable rows actually carry (NullClaw `toString` output — including what `custom` categories look like in production rows), (b) the M91_001 `enforceCap` signature. A `[?]` blocks EXECUTE.

---

## Product Clarity

1. **Successful user moment** — "owner=indy", stored in run 1, is still in the context window at entry 1001 and on day 90; the ops zombie still recognises the May-18 incident even after a noisy month of `daily` writes.
2. **Preserved user behaviour** — same four agent verbs, same API shapes, same window byte budget, same cap; zombies and operators change nothing — `core` already exists on every row.
3. **Optimal-way check** — selection policy is the cheapest fix that targets the actual failure (wrong currency); a bigger window costs tokens every run, a mid-run probe costs plumbing — both stay behind M91_001's evidence gates.
4. **Rebuild-vs-iterate** — iterate: the `Compactor` seam was built for this arm. Hydration stays a pure function of (rows, budget) — determinism preserved; a supermemory-style retrieval stack would trade that determinism away and is rejected.
5. **What we build** — one selective compactor arm, tier-ordered eviction, the two architecture-doc reconciliations, and memory-hygiene guidance prose.
6. **What we do NOT build** — importance scores, time-decay, embeddings, per-zombie tier knobs, new categories.
7. **Fit with existing features** — compounds with continuation chains (each chunk re-hydrates, so pinning protects long incidents); M91_001's drop counters now mean "ephemera dropped", a calmer signal.
8. **Surface order** — no CLI/UI surface; platform policy + docs. M91_004's CLI shows categories so users can see the tiers working.
9. **Dashboard restraint** — nothing new to show; any future "pinned memories" UI stays hidden until M91_001 baselines exist.
10. **Confused-user next step** — "why does my zombie remember X but not Y?" now has a documented answer: Y was `daily`, X was `core`; the hygiene guidance teaches storing load-bearing facts as `core`.

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`** — **RULE SSM** (StaticStringMap for the category→tier lookup), **RULE UFS** (tier-set and category-string constants single-sourced), **RULE NDC** (the old single-currency path is replaced, not left beside the new arm), **RULE FLS** (drain on the eviction query path), **RULE NSQ** (schema-qualified SQL in the eviction DELETE).
- **`dispatch/write_zig.md`** — tagged-union shape for the new arm; comptime exhaustiveness.
- **`dispatch/name_architecture.md`** — hydration-flow description changes → the architecture docs are amended in this same diff (no override exists for this gate).

## Applicable Gates

| Gate | Fires? | Satisfaction strategy |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| ZIG GATE | yes | read `dispatch/write_zig.md`; cross-compile both linux targets |
| PUB | yes — public `Compactor` union gains an arm | FILE SHAPE verdict at PLAN; arm carries the same `compact()` interface |
| Architecture consult | yes — memory flow described in two docs | reconcile `capabilities.md` §4 + `runner_fleet.md` §Memory continuity in the same diff |
| UFS | yes — tier/category constants | named constants; no inline `"core"` literals in queries (parameters from constants) |
| LENGTH | watch — `zombie_memory.zig` grows | split a `memory_tiers.zig` sibling if the file approaches 350 lines |
| SCHEMA / ERROR REGISTRY / UI | no | no schema change, no new error codes, no UI |

---

## Overview

**Goal (testable):** with a durable set over the hydration byte budget, every `core` entry that fits is hydrated before any non-core entry is considered; with a durable set over the entry cap, no `core` row is evicted while any non-core row remains — proven by an integration test that writes one `core` fact, floods 1000 `daily` entries, and finds the `core` fact both hydrated and still in Postgres.

**Problem:** both selection mechanisms key on `updated_at`, which only writes refresh. An identity fact written once in run 1 ages to the bottom: the hydration window cuts it first (newest-first byte budget) and cap eviction deletes it first (coldest-first DELETE). The agent's own discipline (re-storing stable keys) is the only defence, and nothing teaches it. This is the exact failure supermemory's static/dynamic profile split exists for — and the category column already on every row is the unused ingredient.

**Solution summary:** a selective compactor arm pins the `core` tier (all `core`, newest-first, within the unchanged byte budget) and fills the remainder with non-core newest-first; cap eviction orders non-core-coldest first, `core`-coldest only as last resort. Category→tier is a StaticStringMap with `custom`/unknown defaulting to the windowed tier. The two architecture docs that describe the old behaviour are amended in the same diff, and memory-hygiene guidance (store load-bearing facts as `core`; stable keys; `memory_forget` stale entries; keep entries small) lands in `capabilities.md` §4 plus a user-docs page.

---

## Prior-Art / Reference Implementations

- **The seam itself** → `zombie_memory.zig` `Compactor` — the union + pure `compact()` shape is the pattern; the new arm mirrors `recency_window`'s contract (slice in, slice or reordered-owned result out, no allocation if achievable — see Handshake).
- **Category lookup** → existing StaticStringMap usages in the repo (RULE SSM); mirror the nearest one.
- **Doc reconcile** → M84_005 shipped `capabilities.md` §4 + `runner_fleet.md` §Memory continuity edits the same way (small, same-diff).

## Decomposition & alternatives (patch vs refactor)

- **Chosen shape:** policy change in the two functions that already own selection, plus the doc truth. The prose guidance ships here (not a separate workstream) because platform pinning and agent discipline are two halves of one selection story.
- **Alternatives considered:** (1) raise `HYDRATE_WINDOW_BYTES` — rejected: pays tokens on every run and still evicts `core` first at the cap; stays behind the evidence gate. (2) per-zombie tier configuration — rejected: a knob nobody asked for; constants until evidence. (3) an importance column — rejected: a second currency to maintain; category already encodes intent.
- **Patch-vs-refactor verdict:** **patch** — the seam was reserved for exactly this arm; no structural movement.

---

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — Category tiers — DONE

A single source of tier truth: pinned = `core`; windowed = everything else (`daily`, `conversation`, and any `custom` string). StaticStringMap keyed on the stored category string; unknown → windowed (safe default — never accidentally pin).

- **Dimension 1.1** — `core` maps pinned; `daily`/`conversation` map windowed → `test_tier_map_known_categories` — **DONE**
- **Dimension 1.2** — arbitrary custom strings map windowed → `test_tier_map_custom_defaults_windowed` — **DONE**

### §2 — Selective hydration arm — DONE

New compactor arm: pinned tier first (newest-first, cumulative bytes within the budget), then windowed tier newest-first in the remaining budget. Same byte arithmetic as `windowByBytes`. The never-empty guarantee is preserved: if even the newest pinned entry exceeds the budget alone, it still hydrates (mirrors the existing oversized-head rule).

- **Dimension 2.1** — mixed set over budget: all fitting `core` hydrated, remainder filled with newest non-core → `test_selective_pins_core_first` — **DONE**
- **Dimension 2.2** — `core` alone exceeds budget: newest `core` kept to budget, drop counters (M91_001) tick → `test_selective_core_overflow_drops_oldest_core` — **DONE**
- **Dimension 2.3** — set within budget: identical output to passthrough ordering (no behaviour change when nothing is dropped) → `test_selective_noop_when_fits` — **DONE**
- **Dimension 2.4** — determinism: same rows + same budget → byte-identical output across repeated calls → `test_selective_deterministic` — **DONE**

### §3 — Tier-ordered cap eviction — DONE

`enforceCap`'s DELETE selects victims windowed-tier-coldest first; pinned rows are eligible only after every windowed row is gone. Tie order within a tier stays `updated_at` then id (existing tiebreak).

- **Dimension 3.1** — over cap with mixed tiers: only windowed rows evicted; every `core` row survives → `test_evict_windowed_before_core` — **DONE**
- **Dimension 3.2** — over cap with `core`-only set: coldest `core` evicted (last resort), eviction counter ticks → `test_evict_core_last_resort` — **DONE** (the pre-existing all-`core` enforceCap integration test IS this dimension post tier-ordering; reframed in place)
- **Dimension 3.3** — headline: one `core` fact + 1000 `daily` pushes → `core` fact hydrated AND present in Postgres → `test_core_survives_thousand_dailies` — **DONE**

### §4 — Architecture-doc reconcile + hygiene guidance — DONE

`capabilities.md` §4 and `runner_fleet.md` §Memory continuity currently describe pure recency windowing; both are amended to the category-pinned behaviour in this diff. §4 additionally gains the memory-hygiene pattern (store load-bearing facts as `core`; stable keys so upserts refresh instead of duplicate; `memory_forget` stale entries; keep entries small — the agent's own discipline is the documented primary bound). A user-docs page mirrors the guidance for operators writing SKILL.md files.

- **Dimension 4.1** — both architecture docs describe category-pinned selection; no recency-only claim remains → verified by grep in Eval E5 — **DONE** (note: `runner_fleet.md` §Memory continuity actually still claimed *full-set* hydration — pre-window prose, staler than this spec assumed; reconciled to category-pinned all the same. `capabilities.md`'s one unrelated "context recency" cell — the `tool_window` row — reworded so E5 lands empty)
- **Dimension 4.2** — hygiene guidance present in `capabilities.md` §4 and the user-docs page → content review at `/review` — **DONE** (capabilities.md §4 hygiene section + `~/Projects/docs` `memory.mdx` "What survives — selection and eviction" section; the spec's CREATE row became an EDIT — the user-docs Memory page already existed, so the guidance extends it; cross-repo PR usezombie/docs#90 on `chore/m91-002-memory-selection-changelog`, merge after the product PR)

---

## Interfaces

- `Compactor` (public union) gains the `selective: usize` arm carrying the pinned-tier policy. **As-built amendment (resolved at PLAN handshake):** `compact()` keeps its return shape and stays allocation-free, but its input becomes a **mutable** slice (`rows: []MemoryDelta`, was `[]const`) — the selective arm is a two-pass stable in-place **swap** selection, so the slice remains a permutation of its input (kept prefix in original recency order, dropped entries permuted into the tail) and per-entry ownership survives compaction for callers that free individual entries. The one production caller (`listAll`'s arena-owned slice) is unaffected.
- The `recency_window` arm ended up production-caller-less after the hydrate switch and is **removed in this diff** per this section's own RULE NDC conditional (its byte-window arithmetic lives on inside the selective arm; `passthrough` — the tenant-read identity arm — remains).
- `enforceCap` keeps its M91_001 signature; only victim ordering changes.
- No HTTP, wire-shape, or OpenAPI changes — hydration response shape is unchanged; only which entries fill it.

---

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling (system response + what the caller observes) |
|------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `core` tier alone exceeds budget | agent hoards `core` | newest `core` kept within budget; oldest `core` dropped from hydration (still durable); M91_001 drop counters tick; never an empty hydration |
| unknown category string | future NullClaw category / custom | windowed tier by default — never silently pinned; unit-tested |
| all-`core` set over the entry cap | agent stores everything as `core` | coldest `core` evicted (last resort) + eviction counter; the hygiene docs name this as the anti-pattern it is |
| **core-saturated capture blackhole** (surfaced at `/review`, Jun 12, 2026 — Claude adversarial + Codex + security specialist) | a zombie holds ≥cap `core` rows (prompt-injected flood or hoarding); every subsequent **non-core** push is stored then immediately evicted as the only non-core victim, while the capture response reports `stored` | **documented disposition, no code this diff**: blast radius is strictly the agent's own zombie (all queries `WHERE zombie_id`); recovery = stable-key overwrite / `memory_forget` / tenant wipe; the eviction IS visible — `evicted` rides the capture log line + `zombie_memory_cap_evictions_total` — just not the agent-facing response (a wire-shape change this spec forbids). Candidate hardenings for Indy: surface `evicted` in the capture response, or a pinned-tier quota (core ≤ N% of cap/window). Pre-change recency eviction was equally agent-controlled (flooding evicted everything regardless); new here is only the stored-then-evicted shape |
| eviction DELETE fails | database blip | existing warn-and-continue; capture unaffected |
| docs and code disagree post-merge | partial diff | prevented: doc edits are Dimensions in this spec; CHORE(close) blocks until DONE |

---

## Invariants (Hard Guardrails)

1. **`compact()` is pure** — no clock, no randomness, no I/O; same inputs → byte-identical output. Enforced by the function signature (rows + budget only) and `test_selective_deterministic`.
2. **No `core` row is evicted while a non-core row remains** — enforced by the DELETE's victim-selection ordering + `test_evict_windowed_before_core`.
3. **At least one entry always hydrates** for a non-empty set — preserved from the existing arm; unit-tested.
4. **Tier truth is single-sourced** — one StaticStringMap; no inline category literals in SQL (parameters bound from named constants). Enforced by UFS gate + grep in Eval.

---

## Test Specification (tiered)

| Dimension | Tier | Test | Asserts (concrete inputs → expected output) |
|-----------|------|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1.1 | unit | `test_tier_map_known_categories` | `core`→pinned; `daily`,`conversation`→windowed |
| 1.2 | unit | `test_tier_map_custom_defaults_windowed` | `"incident-notes"`→windowed |
| 2.1 | unit | `test_selective_pins_core_first` | 2 old `core` + 5 new `daily`, budget fits 4 → both `core` + 2 newest `daily` |
| 2.2 | unit | `test_selective_core_overflow_drops_oldest_core` | `core`-only set over budget → newest-prefix kept; oldest dropped |
| 2.3 | unit | `test_selective_noop_when_fits` | mixed small set → all entries, original recency order |
| 2.4 | unit | `test_selective_deterministic` | repeated calls, same inputs → byte-identical slices |
| 3.1 | integration | `test_evict_windowed_before_core` | cap 5: 3 `core` + 4 `daily` → 2 coldest `daily` evicted, all `core` present |
| 3.2 | integration | `test_evict_core_last_resort` | cap 3: 5 `core` → 2 coldest `core` evicted, counter +2 |
| 3.3 | integration | `test_core_survives_thousand_dailies` | 1 `core` write + 1000 `daily` pushes → `core` row in Postgres AND in hydrate response |
| 4.1 | — | Eval E5 grep | architecture docs carry no recency-only hydration claim |

Negative coverage rides 2.2/3.2 (overflow paths). Regression: `test_selective_noop_when_fits` pins the no-loss case to existing behaviour; the never-empty rule keeps its existing unit test.

## Discovery (consult log)

- **Consults** —
  - **Architecture consult (Jun 12, 2026):** `runner_fleet.md` §Memory continuity claimed **full-set** hydration (pre-M91_001 prose — staler than the recency-window claim this spec expected); reconciled to category-pinned in the same diff per `dispatch/name_architecture.md` landing rule (b). `capabilities.md` §4 Layer-3 hydration sentence updated; hygiene section added; the unrelated `tool_window` "context recency" cell reworded so Eval E5 greps empty.
  - **Ownership bug caught by the integration tier (Jun 12, 2026):** the first selective-arm draft compacted survivors by **overwrite** (`rows[kept] = d`), which loses dropped entries' pointers and duplicates kept ones — `std.testing.allocator` segfaulted on the per-entry frees in `freeDeltas` (double-free), exactly the arena-masking failure `dispatch/write_zig.md` warns about. Fixed by **swap-based** stable selection: the slice stays a permutation of its input, so per-entry ownership survives for any caller. Production (arena) was never at risk; the contract is now caller-agnostic.
  - **`compact()` signature amendment:** input is now `[]MemoryDelta` (mutable) — recorded in Interfaces; sanctioned by the Prior-Art note's "reordered-owned result" contemplation. Return shape and allocation-free property unchanged.
  - **`recency_window` removed** (with private `windowByBytes`): production-caller-less after the hydrate switch; the Interfaces NDC conditional resolved to removal. `passthrough` retained (tenant-read identity arm + unit coverage).
  - **Unit-test extraction:** in-file the adapter would land ~360 lines (over the 350 cap); pure selection-policy tests extracted to sibling `zombie_memory_test.zig` (registered in `tests.zig`) instead of the spec's named `memory_tiers.zig` source split — same LENGTH intent, standard repo pattern, source stays one module (233 lines).
  - **Make-target naming drift:** the spec's Eval/Acceptance say `make test`; the repo's tier-1 aggregate is `make test-unit-all` (lane: `test-unit-zombied`). Evidence below uses the real targets.
  - **Test-name mapping (RULE TST-NAM):** the spec's logical `test_*` handles map 1:1 to descriptive milestone-free Zig test strings (e.g. `test_core_survives_thousand_dailies` → "integration: one core fact survives a thousand daily pushes — durable and hydrated").
- **Skill chain outcomes** —
  - **`/write-unit-test` (Jun 12, 2026): clean, 1 iteration.** Mode Change-set + Invariant rows. Diff ledger 20/20 resolved: 17 tested · 3 dispositioned (`enforceCap` rows-affected-null warn path — driver-dependent, unreachable on DELETE, unchanged M91_001 surface; ≥100-connection concurrency — the per-zombie single-live-holder affinity invariant + fencing make concurrent `enforceCap` on one zombie architecturally impossible and cross-zombie rows disjoint, writer race pinned by `memory_fencing_test.zig`; fuzz over `tierOf` — total function by construction, `orelse .windowed` cannot panic, representative classes tested). Branch coverage on `selectByTier`: every admission branch enumerated and hit (pinned head/fit/drop, windowed overall-head/fit/drop, saturated remainder). Negative-path ratio ≈58%. Manual mutant audit: boundary `<=`→`<` killed by exact-sum budgets; tier-flip killed by 1.1/2.1; eviction `DESC`→`ASC` killed by 3.1/3.3; swap→overwrite killed live by the per-entry-free segfault (Discovery above). Perf: two-pass allocation-free O(n), n ≤ `MAX_MEMORY_ENTRIES_PER_ZOMBIE`; the headline test exercises max-n. Full ledger reproduced in PR Session Notes.
  - **`/review` (Jun 12, 2026): 4 specialists + Claude adversarial + Codex adversarial (cross-model); one real policy bug found and fixed, all other findings dispositioned.**
    - **FIXED — greedy-vs-prefix (cross-model, high confidence):** the first selective arm was greedy first-fit per tier (after rejecting an oversized entry it kept admitting older smaller ones), while the spec/docs/old `windowByBytes` all say newest-**prefix**. Uniform-size fixtures couldn't tell. Fixed with a `TierRun` admission state machine (first overflow closes the tier) shared by the sizing and selection passes — which also dissolves the pass-lockstep duplication the maintainability specialist flagged and brings `selectByTier` under the 50-line cap. Two mixed-size prefix tests now kill the greedy mutant; zero-core sets are again byte-identical to pre-change behaviour.
    - **FIXED — stale doc comments:** `protocol.zig` (cap/window/response trio described recency-only selection — the shared wire-contract module, worst place to lie), `metrics_memory.zig` ("cold-tail"), `Compactor.passthrough`'s rationale (claimed a tenant-GET caller that doesn't exist — retained per spec as the seam's identity arm, comment now honest), `runner_fleet.md` route cells (segment-less `/v1/runners/me/memory` → `/{zombie_id}` form, matching the registered routes).
    - **FIXED — test gaps (testing specialist + adversarial):** unit-tier permutation/ownership multiset test (the swap→overwrite double-free regression is now caught without a live database), empty-set test, two mixed-size prefix tests, oversized-core-head-with-windowed-present starvation test, and an endpoint-tier test proving the core fact rides the real GET response with exact drop-counter arithmetic.
    - **FIXED — loss accounting simplification (performance specialist):** dropped bytes now sum the permuted tail (`rows[entries.len..]`) — one O(dropped) pass instead of two full passes; same value by the permutation invariant.
    - **DISPOSITIONED — core-saturated capture blackhole (security + adversarial + Codex "block"):** recorded as a Failure Modes row with candidate hardenings for Indy (response `evicted` field = wire change this spec forbids; pinned-tier quota). Bounded to the attacker's own zombie; operator-visible via logs/counters.
    - **NO ACTION:** Codex's unbounded-victim-subquery note (self-healing by design; set is practically bounded by the capture caps; eviction-failure warn path is the deliberate M91_001 capture-durability-first call). `helpers.zig:24` pre-existing stale schema claim (file untouched by this diff). `seedDailies` uid-prefix duplication (matches the sibling loop-test fixture convention; consistency-only).
  - **`/review-pr` (Jun 12, 2026):** structured self-review posted on PR #400 — zero blocking findings on the immutable 12-file diff; verdict APPROVE-shaped (posted as comment; author cannot approve own PR). Observations recorded: `passthrough`'s deliberate retention, and the then-comment-only lockstep invariant — which greptile independently escalated (below).
  - **`kishore-babysit-prs` final report (Jun 12, 2026):**
    - Polls run: 6 (cadence 180→300→600s across two pushes) · Reviews seen: 1 greptile review on PR #400 · docs#90: zero (its earlier finding was handled directly by Indy in docs-repo `06b620a`).
    - Findings actioned: 1 (P2 — "LOCKSTEP INVARIANT is comment-enforced, not compiler-enforced", `zombie_memory.zig`, comment 3400502502). Indy-approved fix `af6f6a2b`: the tier entries moved into one named comptime tuple feeding both the StaticStringMap and a comptime pinned-count assertion (`== 1`), so a second pinned category cannot compile until `enforceCap`'s protected bind widens in the same diff. Tier-1 Fixed reply posted (3400563147); history lines written (project + global, `fix | correctness`). Zig 0.16 note banked: `inline for` inside a `comptime` block is rejected as redundant — plain `for` is the form.
    - Findings deferred: 0 · Rules added: none (single-incident; the history line is the durable record).
    - Stopped: two consecutive empty polls after the fix push; CI green/in-flight, nothing red. PR #400 handed to Indy for merge (docs#90 merges after it).
- **Deferrals** — none; any deferral needs an Indy-acked verbatim quote here.

## Verification Evidence

> Repo target names drifted from this spec's draft commands (see Discovery): tier-1 aggregate is `make test-unit-all`; lint+drain is `make lint-zig` (drain check runs inside it).

| Check | Command | Result | Pass? |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| Unit tests | `make test-unit-all` | `✓ All unit lanes passed` (zombied + zigrunner + ziglib + coverage + bundle) | ✅ |
| Integration tests | `make test-integration` | `✓ [zombied] DB-backed integration tests passed` + Redis lane, exit 0; lane reset schemas (teardown + re-migrate) first — clean-state run | ✅ |
| Lint + drain | `make lint-zig` | `✓ [zig] Lint passed` (fmt, zlint, pg-drain, test-depth, schema gate, line limits, role/legacy sweeps) | ✅ |
| Harness gates | `make harness-verify` | `ALL GATES GREEN` (UFS, DESIGN TOKEN, SPEC TEMPLATE, ERROR REGISTRY, LOGGING, LIFECYCLE, RATES, MS-ID+UI) | ✅ |
| Cross-compile | `zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-linux && zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-linux` | `XC-PASS` | ✅ |
| Doc reconcile grep | Eval E5 | empty | ✅ |
| Inline category literals | Eval E6 | empty | ✅ |
| Orphan sweep (RULE ORP) | `grep -rn "recency_window\|windowByBytes" src/ zombiectl/ ui/ schema/ docs/` (non-spec) | empty | ✅ |
| Gitleaks | `gitleaks detect` | `no leaks found` (2642 commits) | ✅ |
| Test delta | `make _lint_zig_test_depth` | unit 1912→1947 · integration 178→182 vs CHORE(open) baseline; this branch's own additions are +15 unit / +2 integration (post-`/review` round; the endpoint-tier hydrate test lands in the counter's unit bucket by its name-prefix convention) — the remainder arrived with the rebase onto `main` @ `5cb1aa1f` (#398 version-reconcile → 0.41.0, #399 token-splits) | ✅ |
| Memleak | `make memleak` | `✓ [zombied] memleak gate passed` (1244 passed; 366 skipped; 0 failed; macOS SIP "not debuggable" line expected) | ✅ |
| Bench | `make bench` | SKIPPED per environment constraint: `bench-micro` does not compile on `origin/main` (`tests/bench/micro.zig:64` calls missing `webhook_verify.verifySignature` — pre-existing drift, unrelated to this diff) | ⚪ |

**Test Delta row:** unit 1912→1927 (+15) · integration 178→180 (+2) vs CHORE(open) baseline. Lacking: none — the `/review` round closed the prior gap (the hydrate handler's tier behaviour + loss accounting now carry their own endpoint-tier test, `test_hydrate_pins_core_through_the_endpoint`, alongside the pre-existing exact-counter loop tests); `tests.zig` is registration-only.

## Out of Scope

- Importance/priority columns, time-decay scoring, embeddings — rejected currencies (and the latter is behind the governance wall, `direction.md:20`).
- Per-zombie tier configuration — constants until evidence demands a knob.
- Mid-run durable recall probe and window-size changes — Bucket-B rungs behind M91_001's evidence gates.
- `daily` retention — M91_003.
