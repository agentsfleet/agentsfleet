# M50_001: Customer-Development Parallel Workstream

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M50
**Workstream:** 001
**Date:** Apr 25, 2026
**Status:** PENDING

> **Slot history:** M50 was previously assigned to "architecture/ cross-reference + post-launch reflection." That spec was folded into M51 on Apr 25, 2026 (see M51's "Note on M50 fold" section). The slot was reassigned to this customer-development workstream the same day, after a /plan-ceo-review surfaced that customer-dev needed first-class status to hit the Day-50 validation bar. Both decisions land in the same `docs/v2-spec-backlog` branch.
**Priority:** P1 — validation-blocking. The Day-50 success bar (1 external team using on real event for ≥1 week) requires external operators identified, contacted, and committed to install slots BEFORE the substrate ships. Sequential customer-dev (start at Week 6, find users in 14 days) compresses the validation window past breaking. This workstream runs in parallel from Week 1 so the wedge framing is validated while the substrate is still mutable.
**Categories:** RESEARCH, DOCS
**Batch:** B1 — runs in parallel with M40-M48 substrate. ~2-3 hours/week founder time. Non-blocking on engineering work.
**Branch:** No code branch. Artifacts live in `~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/` (local) and Ripley's Log entries (durable record).

**Canonical architecture:** `docs/architecture/` (TOC) → `docs/architecture/high_level.md` §1 differentiation pillars + §5.1 platform-ops persona + `docs/architecture/office_hours_v2.md` P1 persona expansion (AI-infra / GPU-clouds / regulated mid-market / 10x indies / agentic-OS operators).

## Implementing agent — read these first

This workstream is founder-led, not agent-led. The "implementing agent" here is the author working ~2-3 hours/week. Agent assistance is for drafting outreach copy, summarizing call notes, and synthesizing weekly progress, not for sending DMs or running calls.

Required reading before Week 1 outreach:

1. `docs/architecture/office_hours_v2.md` Persona section (lines 36-40) — the explicit P1 + P2 personas and the SaaS-fatigue signal.
2. `docs/architecture/high_level.md` §1 differentiation (3 pillars: OSS + BYOK + markdown-defined) — the actual claim being tested.
3. `docs/architecture/high_level.md` §5.1 platform-ops persona — what the zombie does in concrete terms.
4. The author's existing E2E Networks SRE workflow notes (mental model only, not in repo) — Customer Zero's lived experience, source of credibility in outreach.

---

## Overview

**Goal (testable, Day-35):** 3 named operators (real humans, real companies, real handles) have committed to a Day-35 install slot for `/usezombie-install-platform-ops` on their own infra. "Committed" = (a) accepted a calendar invite, (b) confirmed they can paste a Slack webhook URL on the call, (c) agreed to keep the install on for ≥1 week.

**Goal (testable, Day-50):** 1 of those 3 has installed, kept the install on for ≥1 week, and reported value from a real production event. Names + the event details land in the Ripley's Log.

**Problem:** The substrate workstream (M40-M48) takes 5-6 weeks. The original plan started customer-development at Week 6. That gives 14 days from cold outreach to install-and-soak before the Day-50 bar. Two failure modes that path opens:

1. **Shipping into silence.** Substrate ships, no external operator has touched it, the wedge framing might be wrong, and 5-6 weeks have burned. The signal arrives too late to course-correct cheaply.
2. **No buffer for the messy middle.** External operators don't install on demand. They need 2-3 touch points, an async demo, a peer they trust nudging them. 14 days is not enough.

**Solution summary:** Run customer-dev as a first-class parallel workstream from Week 1. Founder time: ~2-3 hours/week. Output: a curated cold-DM list (15 named operators), a 60-second async demo asset (whatever exists today, even rough), weekly outreach cadence, and a Ripley's Log entry every Friday tracking conversions.

This is not "marketing." This is operator-discovery — finding the 3 humans who would actually install platform-ops on their infra by Day 35. The willfulness move that the office_hours doc explicitly named as a fallback if Day 50 fails. M50 makes it the plan, not the fallback.

## Files Changed (blast radius)

This workstream produces artifacts, not code. No source files change.

| File / artifact | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/cold-dm-list.md` | NEW | The 15 named operators: handle, company, persona match, shared connection (if any), outreach status |
| `~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/demo-asset-v1.mp4` (or `.gif`) | NEW (Week 2) | 60-second async demo of Customer Zero's existing flow. Rough is fine. |
| `~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/outreach-templates.md` | NEW | Cold-DM v1 + follow-up + "demo ready" templates. Iterated weekly. |
| `~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/x-founder-journey.md` | NEW | X draft about the startup journey, producing pull requests, using Greptile, and the event-driven debugging thought that points back to UseZombie. |
| `~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/call-notes/{date}-{handle}.md` | NEW (per call) | Notes from each operator conversation: their workflow today, their current pain, their interest level, the next ask |
| `docs/nostromo/LOG_{date}_M50_CUSTOMER_DEV.md` | NEW (Friday weekly) | Ripley's Log entry: this week's outreach count, conversations, conversion to Day-35 install slot, blockers |
| `docs/architecture/` | NO EDIT here | M51's cross-reference pass picks up persona learnings post-launch |

> **Privacy:** Operator names + handles stay LOCAL to `~/.gstack/`. Nothing committed to the repo until they've explicitly said yes to public attribution. The Ripley's Log entries reference operators by initials or company until written consent.

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — Week 1: Build the cold-DM list (one-time, ~3 hours)

Source the 15 named operators from:

- **AI-infra startups** (founders or platform engineers): scrape recent YC W26 / S26 batches, filter to "AI infra" / "GPU" / "agent infra" tags. Target 5 names.
- **GPU cloud operators**: smaller players (Lambda Labs / RunPod / Vast.ai team members on Twitter, plus E2E Networks peers). Target 3 names.
- **Regulated mid-market** (companies that won't pipe ops into another SaaS for compliance reasons): fintech / healthtech platform engineers visible on Twitter or in public Slack communities. Target 4 names.
- **10x indie engineers / agentic-OS operators**: people building solo-or-small-team AI products who tweet about ops pain. Target 3 names.

For each name, capture in `cold-dm-list.md`:
```
- handle: @example
  company: Example Corp (AI infra YC W26)
  persona: P1 (AI-infra)
  shared signal: tweets about CD pipeline pain Apr 12
  contact path: Twitter DM | warm intro via X | conference connection
  status: not contacted
```

**Disqualifiers:** anyone already on a competitor (Sonarly / incident.io); anyone whose company has >50 engineers (wrong persona); anyone the author has no plausible authentic outreach hook for.

### §2 — Week 1-2: Outreach v1 (cold DMs)

Send 5 DMs/week. Author tone, not corporate. Each DM:

1. **Names a specific recent tweet/post** of theirs that signals the pain (not generic).
2. **States Customer Zero's lived workflow in one sentence.** "I'm an SRE at E2E Networks; I waste an hour every deploy failure correlating logs across Grafana / Zabbix / Django logs / GitHub Actions."
3. **Names what's being built**, briefly. "Building a markdown-defined zombie that wakes on the GH Actions failure and posts the diagnosis to Slack with evidence."
4. **Asks for a 20-min async exchange**, not a meeting. "Would you reply to a 60-second Loom of how it currently works at E2E? No commitment beyond 'yes/no, would this help your team?'"

Track in `outreach-templates.md`. Iterate the template every Friday based on response rate.

### §3 — Week 2: Demo asset v1 (~2 hours)

Record a 60-second screen recording (or animated GIF, or 5-screenshot PDF — whichever is fastest) of Customer Zero's CURRENT manual workflow during a deploy failure. Even rough. The point is to show the pain, not the polish. "This is what I do today" is more compelling than "this is what we're building."

Embed in outreach-templates.md as the asset DM'd to operators who reply "yes, send the demo."

> **Implementation default:** if recording the manual flow is hard, do a Loom of the existing platform-ops sample running locally, even if substrate is incomplete. Operator pattern-matches on "this is the shape" not "this works end-to-end today." Be honest in the DM about what's working vs aspirational.

### §3A — X founder-journey post as discovery asset

Draft one X post or short thread that explains the founder journey in plain language: starting up, using pull requests as the visible unit of product progress, and using Greptile as the review loop that keeps fast changes honest. The post should name the move out of stealth mode: UseZombie is being launched at `usezombie.com`, and the product is now concrete enough to show operators instead of only describing it. The UseZombie insertion is the operational thought from the public site: deploy failures, reviews, failed runs, and production events are signals that should wake a long-lived runtime, collect evidence, and return an evidenced diagnosis instead of becoming another manual debugging session.

This is not a launch announcement. It is a credibility artifact for operator discovery. The post should make the reader understand why event-driven debugging matters before it asks them to care about the product name.

### §4 — Week 3-5: Weekly cadence

Every Monday: send 5 fresh DMs. Reply to anyone from the prior week.

Every Wednesday: do any 20-min async or live calls with operators who said yes.

Every Friday: write the Ripley's Log entry. Track: this week's DMs sent, replies received, calls booked, calls held, install-slot commits secured.

Founder time: 2-3 hours/week max. If it's eating more, the wedge framing might already be wrong — surface that to the author, do not spend more hours.

### §5 — Week 5-6: Convert to Day-35 install slots

By Week 5, the substrate is ~2 weeks from ship. Operators who responded warmly get a follow-up: "Substrate ships ~May 30. Want a 30-min slot the week of June 6 to install platform-ops on your repo? I'll be on the call to debug if anything breaks."

Goal: 3 confirmed install slots before substrate ships.

### §6 — Week 6-8: Install + soak

For each confirmed slot: get them to `/usezombie-install-platform-ops` running on their repo. Stay on the call until first Slack post lands. Send a follow-up after 7 days asking if they kept it on and what value they saw.

Concierge-grade. The Day-50 bar accepts concierge installs.

### §7 — Week 8: Day-50 Ripley's Log entry

Final Ripley's Log entry under M50: how many of the 3 stayed on, what value they reported, what they wished worked differently. Names + company in the log if they consented to public attribution; initials + persona-tag otherwise.

If 0 of 3 converted, surface to the author within 24h. Per office_hours: pivot to operator-discovery (cold DMs to ~15 more named SREs) before more code.

## Interfaces

```
External (Twitter / email / shared Slack):
  Cold DM template → operator reply → demo asset → 20-min async → install-slot commit

Internal artifacts:
  ~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/cold-dm-list.md      (status tracker)
  ~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/call-notes/*.md       (per-conversation)
  ~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/outreach-templates.md (iterated weekly)
  docs/nostromo/LOG_*_M50_CUSTOMER_DEV.md                          (weekly cadence)

Conversion metric (Day-35):
  3 named operators with confirmed install slots in calendar.

Conversion metric (Day-50):
  1 operator kept install on ≥7 days, reported value from real production event.
```

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling |
|------|-------|----------|
| Reply rate <10% on cold DMs after Week 2 | Wrong persona OR wrong pain framing OR wrong asset | Stop, rewrite the DM template + persona target. Don't send 30 more cold DMs at the same template; the data point is real. |
| 0 install slots booked by Week 5 | Wedge framing not resonating | Surface to author within 48h. Pivot decision: change the wedge framing OR delay launch by 2 weeks to retry outreach with different positioning. |
| Operator says yes to install but ghosts on the day | Common. Concierge norm. | Send 1 follow-up after 24h, 1 after 72h. If still no response, deprioritize and add 1 fresh name to the cold-DM list to maintain pipeline. |
| Operator installs but churns within 3 days | Substrate bug, wedge mismatch, or operator-side context shift | First 24h: get on a call, find out why. If substrate bug, file as P0. If wedge mismatch, capture in the Ripley's Log — that's signal. |
| Author runs out of time during a sprint week | Founder time pressure | Skip the week's outreach but DO write the Friday Ripley's Log entry noting the skip. Don't pretend the week happened. |

---

## Invariants

1. **No operator names in the public repo without explicit consent.** Local `~/.gstack/` only.
2. **Friday Ripley's Log entry happens every week, even if the week was zero-output.** The log is the source of truth for whether this workstream is on track.
3. **Founder time stays ≤3 hours/week.** If outreach is eating more, the framing is broken — fix the framing, don't add hours.
4. **Concierge installs count.** The Day-50 bar does not require self-serve. Author-driven first install is fine.
5. **Reply quality > reply count.** 1 deep "yes, this is exactly my pain" beats 5 shallow "interesting, send me more info."

---

## Test Specification

This workstream's tests are observational, not automated. The Friday Ripley's Log is the test artifact.

| Test (observational, weekly) | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_friday_log_exists_for_week_N` | A `LOG_*_M50_CUSTOMER_DEV.md` file exists in `docs/nostromo/` for each Friday between Week 1 and Week 8. No skipped weeks unwritten. |
| `test_dm_count_meets_cadence` | Each weekly log reports ≥5 DMs sent (or explicit reason for skip). |
| `test_pipeline_size_growing` | By Week 4, the cold-DM list has ≥10 operators in active conversation status (not "not contacted"). |
| `test_day_35_commits` | By the Day-35 substrate ship date, ≥3 confirmed install slots booked in calendar. |
| `test_day_50_conversion` | By Day 50, ≥1 operator has kept the install on ≥7 days and reported value from a real event. Logged with names (with consent) or initials (without). |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `~/.gstack/projects/usezombie/customer-dev/cold-dm-list.md` exists with 15 named operators by end of Week 1
- [ ] First demo asset (`demo-asset-v1.mp4` or equivalent) shipped by end of Week 2
- [ ] Friday Ripley's Log entries for every week between Week 1 and Week 8 (no gaps)
- [ ] By Week 5: ≥3 install slots confirmed in calendar for the Week 6-8 window
- [ ] By Day 50: ≥1 external operator has kept platform-ops install on for ≥7 days and reported value from a real production event
- [ ] If Day 50 produces 0 installed-and-used external operators: a documented decision on whether to pivot the wedge framing OR continue with a different outreach strategy. No silent abandonment.

---

## Out of Scope

- **Paid customer-development** (consultants, user-research firms, recruited interviews via UserInterviews.com) — author-driven cold outreach only in v1. Paid CD is a fallback if Day-50 fails.
- **Conference presence / sponsorships** — distribution play, not customer-discovery.
- **Content marketing** (blog posts, technical articles) — separate workstream; M51 owns the docs.usezombie.com positioning content.
- **Content marketing calendar** — M50 allows one X founder-journey post only as an outreach asset. Repeated posts, blog series, launch essays, and docs.usezombie.com positioning remain outside this workstream.
- **Sales pipeline / CRM tooling** — 15 names in a markdown file is the right tool for this stage. Don't graduate to HubSpot / Salesforce.
- **Public attribution of operators without consent** — operator privacy stays opt-in, always.
- **Anything that pulls founder time above 3 hours/week** — substrate work is the day job; this workstream is the parallel discovery channel.

---

## Note on parallelism

This workstream runs alongside M40-M48 substrate. It does NOT block any engineering milestone. It does NOT require engineering review. It is a founder-owned discovery channel whose only artifact in the main repo is the weekly Ripley's Log.

The CHORE(open) for M50 is lightweight: move this spec to `docs/v2/active/`, set Status: IN_PROGRESS, no worktree needed. The CHORE(close) at Day 50 (or Day 60 if soak extends) reviews whether the wedge framing held.
