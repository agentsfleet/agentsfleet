# Scenario 01 — Default install, platform-managed key

**Persona — John Doe.** First-time user. Has a GitHub repo with a CD pipeline. Wants a zombie that wakes on deploy failures and posts diagnoses to Slack. No own LLM key. Brand-new tenant — running on the one-time starter credit grant. Tenant carries no `core.tenant_providers` row — the resolver synthesises the platform default for him.

> **Rate snapshot.** Cent-and-token arithmetic in steps 4–8 was authored against an earlier rate table ($10 starter, 1¢ receive, ~2¢ stage). Current values are different (smaller starter, free receive, sub-cent stage); the *flow* is unchanged. Authoritative source: [`../billing_and_provider_keys.md`](../billing_and_provider_keys.md) §1.

> **Important framing.** There is no separate "Free tier" in v2.0. Every tenant has the same credit-pool billing model and the same cost functions; new tenants just start with a one-time grant. John in this scenario, John in Scenario 02 (after he flips to self-managed), and any future tenant who tops up via support all run through identical code paths and identical billing math. "Free" is a marketing word for "starting credits not yet exhausted," not a code-path concept. See [`../billing_and_provider_keys.md`](../billing_and_provider_keys.md) §2.

**Outcome under test:** From cold start (`zombiectl` not installed) to the first webhook-driven Slack diagnosis in under 10 minutes, with zero manual JSON-editing.

This scenario is the wedge demo. If this path doesn't work end-to-end, nothing else matters.

## 1. Cold install (user's laptop)

The user is already inside their host (Claude Code, Amp, Codex CLI, or OpenCode). They invoke:

```
/usezombie-install-platform-ops
```

The skill's first action is host-neutral: it reads its own `variables:` frontmatter and asks at most four questions through whatever question primitive the host provides (or falls back to inline natural-language Q&A on hosts that have none).

### 1.1 Skill steps

1. **Doctor preflight.** `zombiectl doctor --json` runs. If the CLI isn't installed, the skill prints the one-line install command and stops. If it's installed but unauthenticated, the skill prints `zombiectl auth login` and stops. Doctor is the only sanctioned readiness check; the skill never duplicates the logic.
2. **Repo detection.** The skill reads `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, and `package.json`. If no GH workflow is present, it bails clearly: "GitHub Actions detection required — non-GH CI is in a future version."
3. **Three gating questions.** `slack_channel`, `prod_branch_glob`, `cron_opt_in`. The skill never asks about model or self-managed in this scenario — both default to platform-managed.
4. **Tool credentials.** For each of `fly`, `slack`, `github`, optional `upstash`:
   - try `op read 'op://Personal/<name>/api-token'`
   - else read env `ZOMBIE_CRED_<NAME>_API_TOKEN`
   - else interactive masked prompt
   then `zombiectl credential set <name> --data @-` per credential (upsert; same surface used for the self-managed credential in Scenario 02). JSON is piped on stdin so secret bytes do not appear in shell history or process argv.
5. **Model and cap from doctor.** The skill reads `zombiectl doctor --json`'s `tenant_provider` block, which carries the resolved model + cap regardless of posture. For John (no row): the synthesised platform default — `model: "accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6"`, `context_cap_tokens: 256000`, `provider: "fireworks"`. The platform-side resolver hardcodes the synth-default values; doctor never has to call the model-caps endpoint at runtime.

   The model-caps endpoint at `https://api.usezombie.com/_um/da5b6b3810543fe108d816ee972e4ff8/model-caps.json` is the source of truth, but it is consumed by the platform-side resolver (for the synth-default constants) and by `zombiectl tenant provider set` (Scenario 02), **not** by the install-skill directly. The skill stays simple: read doctor, branch on mode, write resolved-or-sentinel into frontmatter. See [`../billing_and_provider_keys.md`](../billing_and_provider_keys.md) §9 for the endpoint design.
6. **File generation.** The skill writes `.usezombie/platform-ops/SKILL.md` and `.usezombie/platform-ops/TRIGGER.md` substituting variables and the cap. Refuses to overwrite without `--force`.
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: platform-ops
   x-usezombie:
     trigger:
       types: [chat, webhook:github, cron]
       cron: "*/30 * * * *"          # only if cron_opt_in
     model: accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6
     context:
       context_cap_tokens: 256000   # ← from /_um/da5b6b3810543fe108d816ee972e4ff8/model-caps.json

     network:
       allow:
         - api.github.com
         - api.fly.io
         - "*.upstash.io"
         - slack.com
     budget:
       daily_usd: 5
       monthly_usd: 100
   ---
   <SKILL.md prose body — operational behaviour in plain English>
   ```
7. **Install.** `zombiectl install --from .usezombie/platform-ops/`. The CLI POSTs `{trigger_markdown, source_markdown}`; the API parses frontmatter server-side, derives `name` + `config_json`, persists the row, atomically `XGROUP CREATE`s the events stream and `XADD`s `zombie:control`. The worker watcher claims within ≤1s, spawns the per-zombie thread, and no worker restart is required. The dashboard install form exercises the same wire shape by posting pasted `TRIGGER.md` + `SKILL.md`.
8. **Webhook URL + secret.** The skill has already generated the workspace `github.webhook_secret` locally and stored it with `zombiectl credential set github --data @-`. API returns `{zombie_id, webhook_url}`. The skill prints the URL plus the one-time local secret inline:
   ```
   Add this webhook to your repo:
     URL:    https://api.usezombie.com/v1/webhooks/{id}
     Secret: <one-time HMAC-SHA256 secret — copy now, won't be shown again>
     Events: workflow_run
   ```
   Manual step the skill can't automate without a GitHub App — explicitly called out, takes ~30 seconds in the GH UI. (A GitHub App that auto-configures the webhook is a follow-up; v2 keeps the manual step.)
9. **First steer (smoke test).** The skill runs `zombiectl steer {id} "morning health check"` in batch mode and streams the response inline.

### 1.2 What the first steer actually returns

The "morning health check" is **not** a canned ack. It enters the same reasoning loop as any other event — actor `steer:<user>`, type `chat`, into `zombie:{id}:events`. The SKILL.md prose body teaches the agent to handle this input by:

- fetching the latest GH Actions runs on `prod_branch_glob`
- fetching Fly app status / last deploy
- fetching Upstash Redis ping if configured
- posting a one-line "all healthy at HH:MM Z" or a real diagnosis to Slack

So the user sees a **real first-pass evidence sweep**, not a "hello world." This is the install-time proof that everything (creds, network, executor, slack) is wired correctly. If any of the four `http_request` calls fails, the user sees the failure inline and can fix it before any real production webhook arrives.

The webhook-driven path (next section) and this steer path are the **same reasoning loop**. The asymmetry is purely in the input: the webhook brings a `workflow_run` payload; the steer brings the user's text. The SKILL.md prose decides what to do with whichever input arrives. There is no "install-time mode" vs. "production mode" branch — the runtime never sees that distinction.

---

## 2. First production webhook fires

A few hours later, the user pushes a commit. CD fails on a Fly OOM. GitHub Actions fires `workflow_run.conclusion=failure`. The webhook receiver:

1. Verifies HMAC-SHA256 against the workspace credential `github.webhook_secret` stored during install.
2. Normalises payload → synthetic event envelope (actor=`webhook:github`, type=`webhook`).
3. `XADD zombie:{id}:events *` with the envelope.
4. Returns 202 to GitHub.

The per-zombie thread unblocks from `XREADGROUP` within ≤5s. `processEvent` walks the credit-pool gate path (the same code path that scenario 03 walks more deeply):

1. INSERT `core.zombie_events` (`status='received'`, `actor='webhook:github'`, `request_json=<normalised payload>`).
2. PUBLISH `zombie:{id}:activity` (`event_received`).
3. **Resolve provider posture.** `tenant_provider.resolveActiveProvider(tenant_id)` returns the synth-default for John (no row): `{mode: "platform", provider: "fireworks", api_key: <fetched from admin workspace vault via platform_llm_keys pointer>, model: "accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6", context_cap_tokens: 256000}`.
4. **Balance gate.** Estimate = `compute_receive_charge(.platform)` (1¢) + worst-case `compute_stage_charge(.platform, accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6, ESTIMATE_FLOOR, ESTIMATE_FLOOR)` (~2¢) = ~3¢. John has $10 starter (`balance_nanos=1000`); 1000 ≥ 3 → pass. (See [`./03_balance_gate.md`](./03_balance_gate.md) for the gate-trip case.)
5. **Receive deduct.** UPDATE `tenant_billing` SET `balance_nanos = 1000 - 1 = 999`. INSERT `zombie_execution_telemetry` (`event_id`, `posture='platform'`, `model='accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6'`, `charge_type='receive'`, `credit_deducted_cents=1`). One transaction.
6. Approval gate (no destructive tools wired in this zombie) → pass.
7. Resolve `secrets_map` from vault for `fly`, `slack`, `github`, `upstash`. The platform api_key is **not** in `secrets_map` — it travels separately from resolveActiveProvider's return value into `executor.startStage`.
8. **Stage deduct (conservative estimate).** UPDATE `tenant_billing` SET `balance_nanos = 999 - 2 = 997`. INSERT `zombie_execution_telemetry` (`event_id`, `posture='platform'`, `model='accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6'`, `charge_type='stage'`, `credit_deducted_cents=2`, `token_count_input=NULL`, `token_count_output=NULL`). Same transaction shape.
9. `executor.createExecution(workspace_path, {network_policy, tools, secrets_map, context: {context_cap_tokens=256000, tool_window=auto, memory_checkpoint_every=5, stage_chunk_threshold=0.75}, model: "accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6", provider_api_key: <fetched from admin workspace vault via platform_llm_keys pointer>})`.
10. `executor.startStage(execution_id, message=<webhook payload as text>)`.

NullClaw runs the SKILL.md prose against the webhook payload. The agent makes its calls — `http_request GET .../actions/runs/{run_id}/logs`, `http_request GET ${fly.host}/v1/apps/{app}/logs`, etc. — credentials substituted at the tool bridge after sandbox entry. Posts a remediation diagnosis to Slack.

`StageResult{content, token_count_input=820, token_count_output=1040, wall_ms=8210, ttft_ms=320, exit_ok=true}` returns over the Unix socket.

Worker:
- UPDATE `core.zombie_events` (`status='processed'`, `response_text`, `completed_at`).
- UPDATE `zombie_execution_telemetry` stage row (the one INSERTed at step 8) SET `token_count_input=820`, `token_count_output=1040`, `wall_ms=8210`. The `credit_deducted_nanos` column does NOT change — the conservative estimate at step 8 is the charge (v3 may add refund-on-actual; see [`../billing_and_provider_keys.md`](../billing_and_provider_keys.md) §3).
- UPSERT `core.zombie_sessions` (advance bookmark, clear execution handle).
- PUBLISH `event_complete`.
- XACK.

After this event: `balance_nanos = 997`. Two telemetry rows (`charge_type='receive'` + `charge_type='stage'`), both with `posture='platform'`. The user reads the diagnosis in Slack; later opens `zombiectl events {id}` (or the dashboard) to see the full evidence trail and the per-charge-type breakdown.

## 3. Terminal transcript — what John Doe sees

This is the verbatim end-to-end CLI experience. The skill drives most of it; John's only typed inputs are the three variable answers and the GitHub webhook paste.

### 3.1 Skill invocation through to first steer

```text
$ /usezombie-install-platform-ops

▸ Running zombiectl doctor --json …
{
  "auth_token_present": true,
  "workspace_bound": true,
  "tenant_provider": {
    "mode": "platform",
    "provider": "fireworks",
    "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6",
    "context_cap_tokens": 256000
  }
}
✓ Doctor checks pass.

▸ Detecting repo … github.com/john-doe/widgetly

  fly.toml present

▸ Three quick questions:
  Slack channel for diagnoses?     #platform-ops
  Production branch glob?          main
  Periodic health check (every 30 min)?  no

▸ Resolving tool credentials (op → env → prompt fallback) …
  fly       ✓ via op
  slack     ✓ via op
  github    ✓ via env (ZOMBIE_CRED_GITHUB_API_TOKEN)
  upstash   skipped (not detected)

   model: accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6
   context_cap_tokens: 256000     ← from doctor's tenant_provider block

▸ Installing …
  zombie_id   = zmb_01HX9N3K…
  webhook_url = https://api.usezombie.com/v1/webhooks/zmb_01HX9N3K…

✓ Installed. Add this webhook to your repo (Settings → Webhooks):
  URL:    https://api.usezombie.com/v1/webhooks/zmb_01HX9N3K…
  Secret: whsec_<32-byte-base64-elided>
  Events: workflow_run

▸ Running first steer ("morning health check") …
  GH Actions runs on main: 12 in last 24h, all green
  Fly app widgetly-prod: healthy, last deploy 6h ago, 2 instances
  Posted to #platform-ops at 09:14 UTC.

✓ Setup complete. To steer manually:  zombiectl steer zmb_01HX9N3K… "<msg>"
```

### 3.2 First production webhook fires (a few hours later)

```text
$ zombiectl events zmb_01HX9N3K…
EVENT_ID                 ACTOR             STATUS     STARTED              TOKENS  CREDIT
evt_01HX9P7M…           webhook:github    processed  2026-05-01T13:42:01  1840    4¢
evt_01HX9N4P…           steer:john        processed  2026-05-01T09:14:22  1610    4¢
```

John clicks into `evt_01HX9P7M…` in the dashboard and sees the agent's evidence trail — the `http_request` calls to GitHub run logs and Fly app status, the diagnosis posted to Slack. The credential names appear (`github`, `fly`, `slack`); their secret bytes do not.

### 3.3 Provider posture confirmed by `tenant provider get`

```text
$ zombiectl tenant provider get
Mode:                platform   (synthesised default — no explicit row)
Provider:            fireworks
Model:               accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6
Context cap tokens:  256000

ⓘ This is the platform default. To bring your own LLM key:
   op read 'op://<vault>/<item>/api_key' |
     jq -Rn '{provider:"fireworks", api_key: input, model:"accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6"}' |
     zombiectl credential set <name> --data @-
   zombiectl tenant provider set --credential <name>
```

No `core.tenant_providers` row exists for John's tenant; `tenant provider get` reads through the resolver and surfaces the synthesised default, plus an inline pointer at the self-managed setup commands.

---

## 4. What this scenario proves

- The install-skill is the only place where repo detection, ≤4 question discipline, and credential resolution live. The runtime stays prompt-driven.
- The model→cap lookup is **one external GET per install**, pinned into frontmatter. Adding a new model never requires a usezombie release.
- The first steer and the first production webhook hit the **same reasoning loop**. Asymmetry would mean a code-path the SKILL.md author can't reason about — the architecture forbids it.
- Credit deduction goes through the same `zombie_execution_telemetry` insert path under both postures. There is no plan-tier branching — same code path for John (synth-default platform) and any future user on Stripe-purchased credits.

---

## 5. What is NOT in this scenario

- No self-managed. See `scenarios/02_self_managed.md`.
- No balance trip. See `scenarios/03_balance_gate.md`.
- No customer-facing statuspage / external comms. That's the bastion direction documented in [`../bastion.md`](../bastion.md).
- No GitHub App for auto-webhook config. Manual step in v2.
