# Scenario 03 — The credit pool, John drains under both postures

**Persona — John Doe.** Same user from Scenarios 01 and 02. He installed his platform-ops agent cold, ran for a couple of weeks on the default platform-managed posture, then brought his own Fireworks key. This scenario watches his starter grant drain over time across both postures and ends with the gate tripping.

> **Rate snapshot.** The cent-and-token arithmetic below was authored against an earlier rate table (M48 era — $0.01 receive, $0.10 run, $10 starter). Under M66 stealth-mode rates the grant is $5, receive is $0 in both postures, and run is posture-dispatched (platform overhead + token cost / flat self-managed fee). The *flow* — gate, two debit points, telemetry rows — is identical to what's shown; only the per-event arithmetic moves. Authoritative current values: see [`billing_and_provider_keys.md`](../billing_and_provider_keys.md) §1 (sources of truth). Treat the numbers in this scenario as illustrative.

**Outcome under test:** A tenant whose `core.tenant_billing.balance_nanos` reaches zero stops dispatching new events at the gate. Same code path under both postures; only the per-event drain rate differs. The user gets a clear "credits exhausted" UX pointing at the dashboard billing page. There is no Stripe purchase flow in v2.0 — exhausted users contact support for a manual top-up.

---

## 1. The credit pool

John starts with the same balance every new tenant gets:

```
SELECT balance_nanos FROM core.tenant_billing WHERE tenant_id = $1;
 balance_nanos
---------------
          1000
(1 row)
```

That's $10 USD, granted once at tenant-create. There is no monthly refill. There are no plan tiers in the gate — every tenant runs through the same lease/billing code path (`runBilling`) and the same `compute_*_charge` functions. The only number that varies is the drain rate, and the drain rate is purely posture-dependent.

Plans (Free / Team / Scale, if they exist as marketing constructs) only show up at credit-grant time as bigger or smaller starting numbers — never inside the gate or the cost function. In v2.0 we ship one tier: $10 starter grant for every new tenant.

---

## 2. Phase 1 — John on platform-managed (Week 1-2 of his journey)

**Setup recap.** John ran the wedge demo (Scenario 01). His tenant has no `core.tenant_providers` row — the resolver synthesises the platform default: `mode=platform`, `provider=fireworks`, `model=accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6`, `context_cap_tokens=256000`. The actual Fireworks api_key agentsfleet pays Fireworks with is **not** a magic constant. It lives in the `usezombie-admin` user's workspace `vault.secrets` (same M45 crypto_store path any user's self-managed uses); `core.platform_llm_keys` carries a pointer `(provider="fireworks", source_workspace_id=<admin's workspace>)` registered via `PUT /v1/admin/platform-keys` after the admin ran [`playbooks/operations/admin_bootstrap/001_playbook.md`](../../../playbooks/operations/admin_bootstrap/001_playbook.md). The resolver follows the pointer to fetch the key on-demand. The api_key never leaves the path from `agentsfleetd`'s resolver to the runner's inference call; user-facing surfaces (CLI, doctor, dashboard, event log) never see it.

### 2.1 First webhook fires (Monday morning, week 1)

```
XREADGROUP unblocks → INSERT zombie_events (status='received')
resolveActiveProvider → mode=platform
estimate cost = compute_receive_charge(.platform)
              + compute_stage_charge(.platform, accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6,
                                     worst_case_in=900, worst_case_out=1200)
              = 1¢ + (1¢ + 0¢ + 1¢) = 3¢

gate: 1000¢ ≥ 3¢ → pass

DEDUCT RECEIVE
  UPDATE tenant_billing SET balance_nanos = 1000 - 1 = 999
  INSERT zombie_execution_telemetry
    (event_id, posture='platform', model='accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6',
     charge_type='receive', credit_deducted_cents=1)

approval gate → pass (no destructive tools in this run)

resolveSecretsMap → {fly, slack, github}

DEDUCT RUN
  UPDATE tenant_billing SET balance_nanos = 999 - 2 = 997
  INSERT zombie_execution_telemetry
    (event_id, posture='platform', model='accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6',
     charge_type='stage', credit_deducted_cents=2)

issue lease → runner forks NullClaw child
  outbound to api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1
  runner reports: tokens(in=820, out=1040), wall=8.2s

UPDATE zombie_execution_telemetry  (the run row)
  SET token_count_input=820, token_count_output=1040, wall_ms=8210

reconcile actual cost:
  actual_stage = compute_stage_charge(.platform, "accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6", 820, 1040)
               = 1¢ + ((300×820 + 1500×1040) / 1_000_000) ≈ 1¢ + 1¢ = 2¢
  matches the conservative estimate; no adjustment.

UPDATE zombie_events status='processed'
XACK
```

After event 1: balance = 997¢. John spent 3¢ for one event.

### 2.2 Through week 1 and into week 2

Monday's webhook + steers run. John gets ~30 events Monday at an average of 3¢ each = 90¢ spent. Tuesday is busier (a flaky deployment generates 50 webhook events plus a few manual steers) — say 60 events × ~3¢ = 180¢. By end of Tuesday: 1000 − 90 − 180 = 730¢ left.

Wednesday through Friday continue at ~40 events/day × ~3¢ = ~120¢/day. End of week 1: 730 − 360 = 370¢ left.

Week 2 opens. By midweek John is at ~150¢ left and notices his balance is lower than he'd hoped. He decides to bring his own Fireworks key.

---

## 3. Phase 2 — John switches to self-managed (week 2 onwards)

He runs through Scenario 02's setup:

```bash
op read 'op://<vault>/fireworks/api_key' |
  jq -Rn '{provider:"fireworks", api_key: input, model:"accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6"}' |
  agentsfleet credential set account-fireworks-key --data @-
agentsfleet tenant provider set --credential account-fireworks-key
```

`core.tenant_providers` now has a row: `mode=self_managed`, `provider=fireworks`, `model=accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6`, `context_cap_tokens=256000`, `credential_ref=account-fireworks-key`. John's agentsfleet balance is unchanged at ~150¢.

### 3.1 First post-flip event

```
resolveActiveProvider → mode=self_managed, api_key=fw_LIVE_…, model=kimi-k2.6
estimate cost = compute_receive_charge(.self_managed) + compute_stage_charge(.self_managed, …)
              = 0¢ + 1¢ = 1¢

gate: 150¢ ≥ 1¢ → pass

DEDUCT RECEIVE → 0¢ deducted (self-managed receive is zero in v2.0)
  INSERT telemetry (charge_type='receive', credit_deducted_cents=0)

DEDUCT RUN → 1¢ deducted
  UPDATE balance_nanos = 150 - 1 = 149
  INSERT telemetry (charge_type='stage', credit_deducted_cents=1)

runner's NullClaw child (provider key fw_LIVE_…) → outbound to
  api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1/chat/completions
runner reports: tokens(in=820, out=1320), wall=11.4s
  — tokens recorded on the row, but compute_stage_charge under self-managed
    does NOT consume them (flat 1¢ regardless of token count)

UPDATE telemetry run row SET token_count_input=820, token_count_output=1320,
                              wall_ms=11400
(credit_deducted_cents stays 1¢; tokens are FYI only under self-managed)

UPDATE zombie_events status='processed'
XACK

Fireworks bills John's Fireworks account directly for the 820+1320 tokens
of Kimi K2.6 on his own monthly invoice. agentsfleet sees only the
reported token count for telemetry; we do not know what Fireworks
charged John for those tokens, and we do not care.
```

After this event: balance = 149¢. John's agentsfleet drain dropped from ~3¢ to 1¢ per event the moment he flipped postures.

### 3.2 Through weeks 2-4

Same workload shape (~40 events/day) but now at 1¢ each = ~40¢/day instead of ~120¢/day. John's 150¢ remaining at flip time would cover roughly 4 more days under platform; under self-managed it covers roughly two weeks.

By end of week 4: balance ≈ 30¢ left.

---

## 4. Phase 3 — the gate eventually trips

Week 5 opens. John's balance is hovering around 30¢. A flaky deploy triggers a 30-event burst from his CD pipeline. The lease path runs through the first 30 events at 1¢ each, draining to 0¢:

```
estimate cost = 1¢
gate: 0¢ < 1¢ → BLOCK

UPDATE zombie_events
  SET status='gate_blocked', failure_label='balance_exhausted'
PUBLISH event_complete (status=gate_blocked)
XACK terminal
```

The next event (and every event after) gate-blocks identically. None of them reach the runner; agentsfleet's costs for them are SQL-only.

John's experience:

- His Slack stops getting diagnoses around the burst's end.
- He runs `agentsfleet billing show` and `agentsfleet events <id>` (transcripts in §6).
- He opens `https://app.usezombie.com/settings/billing`, sees the empty-balance state, and emails support for a top-up. Stripe Purchase Credits ships in v2.1.
- After support tops him up to $10 again, he can re-trigger the missed events manually if any are worth running. There is no auto-replay of gate-blocked events.

Note that the gate trip happens identically under both postures — the only difference is *when* it happens. Had John never flipped to self-managed, his $10 would have run out around the start of week 2 instead of week 5.

---

## 5. Same user, two drain rates — comparison

The same user with the same workload sees different drain rates depending on which posture he's in. Cumulative spend over ~5 weeks of identical activity:

| Phase | Posture | Events/day (avg) | ¢/event | ¢/week (5 days × 40 events) | Cumulative ¢ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1-1.5 | platform | 40 | ~3 | ~600 | ~850 (full week + half) |
| Week 1.5-5 | self_managed | 40 | 1 | ~200 | ~150 over 3.5 weeks |
| **Total** | mixed | — | — | — | **1000 (the starter grant)** |

If John had stayed on platform the entire time, his $10 would have lasted roughly 1.5–2 weeks. Switching to self-managed extended his runway to ~5 weeks for the same workload. The 3× extension is the self-managed incentive — paid for by his separate Fireworks bill.

| Aspect | Platform phase | self-managed phase |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant_providers` row | Absent (synth-default) | `mode=self_managed`, `credential_ref=account-fireworks-key` |
| Resolver returns | `{provider: fireworks, api_key: <fetched from admin workspace vault via platform_llm_keys pointer>, model: accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6, …}` | `{provider: fireworks, api_key: fw_LIVE_…, model: …kimi-k2.6, …}` |
| Receive deduct per event | 1¢ | 0¢ |
| Run deduct per event | 1¢ overhead + token cost (~1–4¢ for Kimi K2.6 platform retail) | 1¢ flat |
| Typical per-event total | ~3¢ | 1¢ |
| LLM bill payer | agentsfleet (passthrough in our token rate) | John's Fireworks account directly |
| Outbound LLM call | `api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` | `api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` |
| Gate code path | Identical | Identical |
| Telemetry rows per event | 2 (receive + run) | 2 (receive=0¢, run=1¢) |

```

The Usage tab shows John's full posture history — the three platform rows from his first week and the recent self-managed rows side-by-side. Under self-managed the `IN_TOK` / `OUT_TOK` columns are populated for transparency (John can reconcile against his Fireworks bill) but the `STAGE` cents column is flat 1¢ regardless of token count.

### 6.2 The dashboard

`https://app.usezombie.com/settings/billing` shows:

- Headline: **$0.00 USD**.
- **Purchase Credits** button (disabled, tooltip "Coming in v2.1 — contact support for a top-up").
- Usage tab populated with John's drain history (both posture phases visible).
- Invoices tab: empty state.
- Payment Method tab: empty state.
- Auto Top Up card: hidden (not shipped in v2.0).

### 6.3 No automatic replay

Once topped up (manually in v2.0; via Stripe in v2.1+), the gate-blocked events do **not** auto-replay. If John wants to re-process a missed webhook, he:

1. Re-triggers from the source (push a no-op commit, send another steer), or
2. Uses the resume affordance — which writes an `actor=continuation:<original>` event referencing `resumes_event_id=<blocked_row>`, dispatched cleanly through the gate at the new balance.

The reasoning is that a balance-exhausted event is usually evidence the user was already off the rails (runaway loop, mis-configured cron). Auto-replay would compound the bill.

---

## 7. Posture-switch mechanics

John can flip postures at any time during his journey. The mechanics:

- **Platform → self-managed** (what John did at the start of week 2):
  ```
  op read 'op://<vault>/<item>/api_key' |
    jq -Rn '{provider:"fireworks", api_key: input, model:"accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2.6"}' |
    agentsfleet credential set <name> --data @-
  agentsfleet tenant provider set --credential <name>
  ```
  Next event resolves `mode=self_managed`. Drain drops from ~3¢ to 1¢ per event. The api_key is in vault; he never sees it again from any agentsfleet surface.

- **self-managed → platform** (e.g. if Fireworks has a billing issue):
  ```
  agentsfleet tenant provider reset
  ```
  Next event resolves `mode=platform`. Drain jumps from 1¢ to ~3¢. If his balance is now too low for the platform-rate worst-case estimate, the gate trips on the next event — he'd see the credit-exhausted UX and need to top up.

In-flight events finish under the posture they were claimed under (gate snapshot). No mid-execution re-billing.

---

## 8. Edge cases

### 8.1 Mid-event balance crossing zero

In-flight events finish at the snapshot taken at gate time. Both deductions (receive + run) committed at lease issue, before the runner ran; the runner's success or failure does not retroactively adjust the deduction. If the user's balance crosses zero during a long run, the next event hits the gate cleanly and blocks.

### 8.2 Concurrent events on near-zero balance

Two events claim the queue simultaneously, both pass the gate (balance was sufficient for one), both deduct → balance briefly goes negative. We accept the small overshoot rather than serialise all events behind a row lock that would limit throughput. The next event sees `balance_nanos < 0`, gate trips, system stabilises.

### 8.3 Posture flip mid-event

The resolver runs exactly once at gate time (step "Resolve posture" in the flowchart). Whatever posture it returned is the snapshot for both deductions and the outbound LLM call. A `tenant provider set` that lands during step 3-7 of the flowchart has no effect on this event; it takes effect on the next event.

### 8.4 self-managed credential deleted while still in self-managed mode

Resolver returns `error.CredentialMissing`. Event dead-letters with `failure_label='provider_credential_missing'`. **Receive is not debited** (we couldn't even resolve posture, so we wouldn't know which receive rate to use); the dead-letter row stays at the very-early step. This is a different terminal state than `balance_exhausted` and the dashboard distinguishes them.

---

## 9. What this scenario proves

- **Same code path serves both postures.** The gate, the receive deduct, the run deduct, and the telemetry rows are identical SQL; only the cents differ.
- **Drain rate is the self-managed signal.** John's agentsfleet credits last ~3× longer under self-managed than they would have under continued platform use — a transparent, observable benefit of bringing a key.
- **Plan tiers are not a code-path concept.** They never appear inside the lease path or `compute_*_charge`. Future plan tiers will manifest only as different starting grants or recurring top-ups, not as branches in the gate.
- **The api_key boundary holds in production traffic.** A grep across `core.zombie_events`, `core.zombie_execution_telemetry`, `agentsfleetd` logs, runner logs, and HTTP responses for either api_key (the admin workspace Fireworks key fetched via `platform_llm_keys`, or the user's own `fw_LIVE_…`) returns zero hits across the entire test run. (M48 acceptance criterion; tested in CI.)
- **The credit-exhausted UX is a dashboard story, not a CLI story.** The CLI surfaces the state and points at the dashboard. Purchase / top-up are dashboard-shipping concerns (and ship empty in v2.0, with the actual Stripe integration in v2.1).

---

## 10. Open questions deferred to v2.1+ and v3

- **Stripe Purchase Credits flow.** v2.1. Adds `core.credit_purchases` table, Stripe webhook handler, dashboard button enablement.
- **Auto Top Up** when balance drops below a threshold. v2.1.
- **Plan tiers as recurring credit grants.** v2.1+ if onboarding metrics suggest the $10 starter is the wrong knob. Any plan tier ships as a recurring Stripe charge that tops up `balance_nanos` — never as a branch inside `compute_charge`.
- **Refund-on-actual-tokens.** v3. Today the conservative estimate is the charge; reconciling to actual tokens adds bookkeeping for marginal accuracy gain.
- **Per-workspace soft caps inside a tenant.** v3 — needs a new gate at the workspace level.
- **Volume discounts.** v3, sales-led.
- **Auto-fallback from self-managed to platform on provider error.** Errors surface to the user; no silent fallback (would charge them without consent).
