-- Tenant-scoped LLM provider configuration. One row per tenant who has
-- explicitly configured a provider; absence of row is the synthesised
-- platform default.
--
-- The resolver (src/state/tenant_provider.zig) treats "no row" and
-- "row with mode=platform" as semantically identical for runtime behaviour.
-- An explicit row is written when the user runs `tenant provider reset`
-- so the dashboard can distinguish "never configured" from
-- "explicitly reset".
--
-- Value constraints (mode ∈ {platform, self_managed}; credential_ref nullability
-- tied to mode) are enforced in application code via constants in
-- src/state/tenant_provider.zig — RULE STS forbids static-string CHECKs.
