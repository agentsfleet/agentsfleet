-- Zombie session CHECKPOINT BOOKMARK table.
-- One row per Zombie — upserted after each event delivery.
-- context_json: conversation resume cursor — serialized as {last_event_id, last_response}.
--   NOTE: This is NOT agent memory. Agent memory lives in the dedicated `memory`
--   schema. Writing full conversation history or memory tool outputs here is not
--   what this column is for.
-- checkpoint_at: millis timestamp of last successful checkpoint.
-- On crash + restart, worker reads this row to resume from the last event cursor.
--
-- execution_id + execution_started_at track the active executor session.
-- Set by the worker at createExecution, cleared at destroyExecution and on claim (crash recovery).
-- NULL means the zombie is idle. Non-NULL means it is actively executing an event.
